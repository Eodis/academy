Save More Money 
----------------

You know the desire to have the best food, ideally the healthy stuff. The next one is to have a decent home, ideally, one you are proud of. Not to forget, to have your body in the best possible physical and emotional shape. Additionally, to be in a good relationship with your loved ones and your communities. And finally, to be able to give back the best you can and to fulfill your dreams.

**Your desire to survive and thrive in today’s economy is mainly bound to the state of your own finances.**

But did you know that, if you use “free” internet service, it is not really free? No, instead of paying with your money, you pay with your valuable data. 

Now, you can change that. :term:`Particl Marketplace` does not seek revenues from selling off your data or through fees. It doesn’t need that data and income because there are no corporate interests behind it. Instead, the Particl team is sponsored entirely by community donations and aims to become self-perpetual without compromising you. The total cost of commerce gets lowered.


*We help you to save more or make more money by cutting out the middle-man*

----

Gain Security and Privacy
-------------------------

Big corporations collect data with your purchases and sales. The data is then utilized to evaluate you as a business owner or as a consumer. They sell your data or use it against you in a way they can benefit without your knowledge or consent. A lot of times, this is done at your own detriment.
 
**Corporations like e-commerce giants have become your credit score broker!**

* Based on their risk assessment they rate your insurance policies 
* Your personal preferences will be the reason why you may not get a particular job 
* Or even worse, a rating algorithm could block your accounts! 

The ever-growing-and-already-giant e-commerce corporations always seek to expand their profits, market power, and control. They have created today's very disturbing digital security and privacy crisis under the guise of usability and convenience.

*We help you to match full control of your data and freedom*

**You stop Invasion of Privacy or Backdoors** 

No more stolen credit card information, compromised email accounts, or any possibility of surveillance. When data is not created, it cannot be collected by anyone. It cannot be attained, shared, sold, misused, hacked, or leaked. Your data stays your data regardless of whether it relates to your products, locations, payments, or any online activity–for both customers and vendors. You can now defend the human right of privacy to create an umbrella for today's and the future's technical and political uncertainties.

*We help you to become invincible to privacy issues*

**You stop Restrictions, Politics, and Malice**

A 100% uptime that is impossible to be taken offline or manipulated. It also means none of your products, vendors, or customers can be banned from the :term:`Particl Marketplace` or be censored by any governing body or legislation. Instead, the community remains in charge of the marketplace’s content at all times. Across national borders, free trade and free markets are possible so that manufacturers, vendors, and producers can freely decide how and with whom they do business.

*We help you to become bullet-proof against restrictions*

**You stop Fraud and Trickery**

No more bricks in the package or bad quality counterfeit goods for you as a customer. No more chargebacks for vendors due to stolen identities. Fraudulent attempts get taken down with a free of charge and automated two-party escrow system.

*We help you to become immune to online fraud*

**You stop Spam**

Tailored ads are hammering on you even after you have made a purchase, and most of the time, even before you make it. You have seen them on websites you visit, read them within your email accounts and apps you use. It even affects how search engines deliver results to you and they track your location.

*We help you to have the cure against spam*

Enjoy Giving Back
-----------------

E-commerce and online marketplaces have made the world of shopping and selling a very different place. Small businesses have had to give up, while only a handful of large corporations continue to dominate the market. The price war destroyed small merchants, only to benefit Internet platforms and financial transaction providers. This also applies to all employees in the retail industry.   

**To Small Merchants, Manufacturers, and Producers**

Breaking the value chains gives merchants, manufacturers, and producers of goods the ability to build a livelihood that is no longer dependent on middlemen and large corporation's interests.

**To Local Shops and Co-operatives**

Local shops and co-operatives in your proximity do get the ability to setup their own internet shops at virtually no costs of commerce or maintenance, and without external interference.

**To Yourself and your Communities**

Some say, sustainability and responsability are cornerstones of a healthy economy. Don't wait for somebody to make the economy better. Be your own revolution and liberation. Share and discuss it with your communities.

*It’s time to give back to the small, to the oppressed, to the exploited.*

How it Works
-------------

:term:`Particl Marketplace` relies on open-source technologies that are openly audited, inspected, and improved by the global community. Each and every single component of the marketplace is designed to keep you, your funds, and your personal information safe.

It is based on distributed ledger and :term:`peer-to-peer <Peer-to-Peer>` technologies, which you may know by hearing :term:`Blockchain` and Bitcoin's synonyms. It runs on a distributed network (:term:`Particl Network`) of :term:`nodes <Node>` hosted by volunteers scattered across the world. It is an entirely autonomous platform that doesn’t require any central party to operate, which means no company or organization is between buyers and sellers.
