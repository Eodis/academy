**Particl is a two-sided marketplace like Amazon, eBay, and Alibaba, but without the fees, the sales commissions, and the personal information requirements.** It is deployed on a distributed person-to-person (P2P) network that lets you connect directly, without the help of any intermediary, with buyers and sellers from all around the world. 

Because of its distributed nature, there is no party like a marketplace operator or payment processor sitting in the middle of any transaction you make on the marketplace. That means there's no one to charge you fees, commissions, or to collect your personal information and data. It is, simply put, the digital equivalent of an in-person cash transaction between you and someone else.

Benefits of using Particl
-------------------------

When you buy or sell something using cash, you don't need a third person to move the cash from your hands into the other person's hands. You can just do it yourself. 

Unfortunately, and up until now, digital technologies didn't allow for these kinds of person-to-person transactions to happen. In the world of eCommerce and online marketplaces, this has led to sky rocketting costs and fees, more expensive retail prices on products and services, and has gave birth to a terrible digital security and privacy crisis.

Particl, however, is different. It is a **decentralized marketplace**. Its unique combination of blockchain and peer-to-peer technologies unlocks benefits and a level of security long thought to be impossible on the web. Let's see what these benefits are and how they can make your life better.

No sales commission
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Similarly to torrents, Particl runs on a distributed network of nodes hosted by volunteers scattered across the world. **It is a completely autonomous platform that doesn't require any central party to operate**, which also means that there is no company or organization charging you fees and taking a commission out of every sales.  

It's true! On Particl, **there is no commission/sales fee, no subscription fee, and no escrow fee, no nonsense.** The only fee the platform charges, which is only in place to fight off spam, is a small listing fee when putting items up for sale on the marketplace. But don't worry, these fees are most often than not smaller than a penny and are entirely redistributed to the volunteers who support the network by `staking <../in-depth/indepth_staking.html>`_. 

- **As a seller**, you get to keep the totality of your sales revenue in your pockets. You can then lower your prices to increase your sales volume, beat your competitors, and **still make more money per sale**!

- **As a buyer**, you definitely get to benefit from this as well by gaining access to more affordable products than on traditional marketplaces. When sellers don't need to pay the marketplace a portion of their revenue, everyone wins!

Unstoppable, uncensorable
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Particl is a very resilient platform operating on the basic principles of free market and direct democracy. Because the marketplace runs autonomously on a distributed and global network of nodes, it cannot be shut down or censored by any authority.

This gives Particl a **100% uptime** and makes it **impossible to be taken offline**. It also means no product or user can be banned from the marketplace or be censored by an administrator or central authority. Instead, you, along with the rest of the community, are in charge of the marketplace's content moderation. Learn more about marketplace moderation `here <../in-depth/indepth_mp_moderation.html>`_.

Unmatched security and privacy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you start using Particl, data breaches and the abuse of your personal information become things of the past. Thanks to its unique combination of blockchain and peer-to-peer technologies, Particl provides you with the highest level of eCommerce security possible to this day. In fact, the marketplace guarantees that **your personal information remains private at all time**. The way this can be guaranteed is that no such data is created in the first place. If no meaningful data about you and your activities exists in the first place, then it can't be collected, shared, sold, misused, hacked, or leaked by any party.

Particl is built from the ground up with digital security and user privacy in mind. Buy and sell anything online without leaving any digital footprint behind.


Is it Safe?
---------------------------

Particl, first and foremost, prioritizes the security of your personal information and data. It is the most secure and private online marketplace on the web. It relies on secure and open-source technologies that can be openly audited, inspected, and improved by the global community. Each and every single component of the marketplace is designed to keep you, your funds, and your personal information safe.

However, it's important to be aware that Particl is heavily based on blockchain and cryptocurrency technologies. This means you, and only you, have the responsibility to ensure the security and custody of your funds. You are in complete control!
