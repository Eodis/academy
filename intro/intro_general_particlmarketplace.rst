What's |PM|
==============

|PM| is similar to the internet’s well-known marketplaces (Amazon, eBay, Alibaba), but with features customers and vendors love. No intentions to make profits, and you can be sure your needs are and remain protected.

**Free markets. Unhindered e-commerce.**

* **More money** in your pocket to spend or save on life and dreams
* **Gain security** of not being a product or a glass consumer—no fraud, trickery, invasion of privacy, spam, restriction, politics, or malice possible
* **Enjoy standing** and giving back to society

Equip yourself with sophisticated technology that is made very easy to use. This single choice makes you stop feeding the corporate monopolies. Your world becomes a fairer place while showing the people around you care about them and society. Resulting nothing more is at stake, and you’ll feel like a champion.

Keep more money
----------------

Yes, precisely that. With Particl Marketplace, you found a marketplace that does not seek revenue from fees or selling your data. Effectively, it doesn’t create that data at all because no corporation is behind it.

The Particl Team lives off donations and aims to become self-perpetual, but without compromising you.

Gain security
----------------

The emerged giant e-commerce companies seek to expand further profits, market power, control. They created a disturbing digital security and privacy crisis under the guise of usability. We don't talk about the daily ad's spam, which you also do fight off with Particl Marketplace. We talk about serious threads to your autonomy.

The data the big companies collect with your purchases and sales are utilized to evaluate you as a consumer, and they sell these data or are used against you as a vendor. Translated, this means: 

**E-commerce giants have become your credit score broker!**

* They will decide how high your insurance policy should be rated based on their risk assessment 
* Your personal preferences will be the reason why you don't get a particular job 
* Or even worse, a rating algorithm will block your accounts! 

You change that by making a decision and a commitment to yourself. Install |PM|.

**Get rid of Fraud & Trickery**

No more bricks in your package as a customer or bad quality counterfeit goods. No more chargebacks for vendors due to stolen identities.

Fraudulent attempts get taken down with a free of charge and automated two-party escrow system. You'll become bullet-proof to these types of disruptions if you install |PM|.

**Get rid of Invasion of Privacy or Backdoors** 

No more stolen Credit Card data, compromised email accounts, or any possibility of surveillance. Where no data is created, it can't be leaked to anyone. It can’t be collected, shared, sold, misused, hacked, or leaked. Your data stays your data, including products, locations, and payments—for customers and vendors. You'll become invincible without leaving any digital footprint behind.

**Get rid of Restriction & Politics, or Malice**

You'll have a 100% uptime marketplace impossible to be taken offline. It also means none of your products or users can be banned from the |PM| or be censored by any malice, politics, or oppression. Instead the community is in charge of the marketplace’s content moderation.

**Get rid of Spam**

You know the tailored ads hammering on you even after you made a purchase. You've seen them on websites you visit, read them within your email accounts and apps you use. It even affects how search engines deliver results to you. Forget it. You have the vaccine now.

Enjoy giving back
-----------------

The world of e-commerce and online marketplaces has made the world of shopping a very different place. Small businesses have had to give up, and only a few large companies are still pocketing the profits. The price war is being fought on small merchants' backs to benefit Internet platforms and financial transaction providers. This applies in particular to **all** employees in the retail industry.

**Now it's your giving-back day to the small, to the oppressed, to the exploited.** 

How it's done

With the award-winning |PM|, first and foremost, you prioritize the security of your personal information and data. It is the most secure and private online marketplace on the web. 

It relies on open-source technologies that are openly audited, inspected, and improved by the global community. Each and every single component of the marketplace is designed to keep you, your funds, and your personal information safe.

However, |PM| is based on distributed ledger technologies, which you may know by hearing Blockchain and Bitcoin's synonyms. It runs on a distributed network (:term:`Particl Network`) of nodes hosted by volunteers scattered across the world. It is an entirely autonomous platform that doesn't require any central party to operate, which means no company or organization is between buyers and sellers. You are in complete control!
