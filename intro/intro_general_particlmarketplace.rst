**The world is in a state of constant change. That's why you also need to change to stay ahead of the curve and maintain your liberties and a bright future.**

*You will feel like you have superpowers!*

Protect Your Finances
---------------------

In today's economy, your survival and ability to thrive are mainly bound to the state of your finances. So protecting your finances then becomes a natural desire. But did you know that “free” internet services and online platforms are not really free?

In fact, it's quite the contrary. Instead of paying with your money, you pay with your invaluable data and personal information. And that's on top of the commissions and fees that sellers pay, which is ultimately reflected in retail prices. 

:term:`Particl Marketplace` does not seek revenues from selling off your data or through fees. It doesn’t need that data and income because there is no company, third-party, nor corporate interest behind it.

Instead, the platform is developed by the Particl team, which is supported entirely by community donations. This enables the team to provide you with a groundbreaking and fair e-commerce platform without compromising you, your privacy, and your data. This brings down the total cost of doing online commerce.


*"We help you to save more or make more money by cutting out the middle-man."*

Stand For Liberty
-----------------

Big corporations running popular online marketplaces collect data from you with every purchase or sale you make. They even do it the second you land on their website and start browsing. Then, they use your data to analyze your behaviors as an online merchant or a consumer and increase their bottom line. 

They sell your personal information or use it against you, without your knowledge or consent, in any way that can benefit them. You've guessed it. You have become the product, and these corporations are stealing from you behind your back!
 
**Corporations, like e-commerce giants, have become your credit score brokers.**

* Based on their risk assessment, they rate your insurance policies.
* Your personal preferences and online habits may be the reason why you may not get a particular job. 
* Or even worse, rating algorithms could block your bank accounts and restrict some of your physical and online access in the future! 

**The centralization of powers online is ushering in a dystopian world. Something has to change, and quick!**

The ever sprawling giant e-commerce corporations always seek to expand their profits, market power, and control. They have created today's alarming digital security and privacy crisis under the guise of usability and convenience. And with all the information they possess on all of us, they've become more powerful than even national governments! 

Believe it or not, protecting your data is protecting your finances, your human right to freedom, and ultimately, your quality of life.

*"We help you keep full control of your data and personal information."*

Squash The Rogues
-----------------

:term:`Particl Marketplace` enables you to do e-commerce in a way that's more reliable and safe for you. Using a novel combination of distributed technologies and robust security protocols, you get all the tools you need to squash the rogues lurking on the internet.

**Stop Privacy Invasions and Backdoors** 

No more stolen credit card information, passwords, email accounts, or personal information. :term:`Particl Marketplace` also makes it impossible for anyone to surveil your online activity. 

When no data about you is created in the first place, it cannot be collected, shared, sold, misused, hacked, or leaked. With Particl, your data stays your data at any point in time. That’s true for sellers and buyers regardless of whether it relates to your products, locations, payments, shipping information, preferences, or any online activity. As a result, you can now defend your inherent right to privacy and shield yourself from the many technical and political uncertainties that plague today’s world.

*"We help you become invincible to privacy issues."*

**Stop Restrictions, Politics, and Malice**

Use an online e-commerce platform that has a 100% uptime and that is impossible to be taken offline or manipulated. No merchant, buyer, or product can be banned, censored, or canceled by all-powerful tech overlords. Instead, it's Particl's community that is in charge of what content is allowed or not on the marketplace. 

Across national borders, free trade and free-market are now possible without the interference of governing bodies or unfair legislation. Manufacturers, vendors, and producers can then freely decide how and with whom they do business, and they can finally thrive up to their fullest potential.

*"We help you thrive in the global market and become bullet-proof against unfair restrictions."*

**Stop Fraud and Trickery**

No more bricks in the package or bad quality counterfeit goods for you as a customer. No more chargebacks for vendors due to stolen identities. Fraudulent attempts get taken down with a free of charge and automated :doc:`two-party escrow system <../in-depth/indepth_escrow>`.

*"We help you become immune to online fraud and scammers."*

**Stop Spam and Unwanted Solicitations**

Tailored ads are hammering on you even after making a purchase, and most of the time, even before you make it. You see them on the websites that you visit. You encounter them throughout your emails and directly on the apps that you use. It even affects how search engines deliver results to you. Invasive ads follow you wherever you go, and, every day, they crawl deeper into your life. It has to stop!

*"We help you by giving you the cure against spam."*

Contribute To Society
---------------------

E-commerce and online marketplaces have made the world of shopping and selling a very different place than what it used to be. The price wars destroyed small merchants only to benefit online platform operators and financial services providers. 

As a result, many small businesses have had to give up, while only a handful of large corporations continue to dominate the market with immoral practices. The ones who suffer the most are, as always, the low-to-middle-class people, who are the heart of every nation throughout the world.

By using :term:`Particl Marketplace`, you make a direct contribution to society by pledging to make the world of e-commerce a much better place than it currently is. That's regardless of where you are in the world.

**Pledge to Small Merchants, Manufacturers, and Producers**

Breaking the online monopolies gives merchants, manufacturers, and producers of goods and services the ability to build a livelihood that is no longer dependent on middlemen and large corporation's interests.

**Pledge to Local Shops and Co-operatives**

Local shops and co-operatives in your proximity get the ability to set up their own internet shops at virtually no cost, no maintenance requirement, and without any external interference.

**Pledge to Yourself and Your Communities**

Some say that sustainability and responsibility are the cornerstones of a healthy economy. Don't wait for somebody to make the economy better. Be your own revolution and liberation. Share and discuss :term:`Particl Marketplace` with your communities and help them improve their situation.

*"Giving back to the small, the oppressed, and the exploited is as important as it has ever been. Now you can do your part to reduce global inequalities and competitive disadvantages."*

Your Successes
--------------

By :ref:`installing <Installation Guides>` and using :term:`Particl Marketplace`, you make a conscious decision that rewards you heavily.

* You get lower product prices as a customer and higher margins as a vendor
* You become the master of your date and personal freedom
* You become immune to online fraud
* You become invincible to privacy issues
* You get bullet-proof protection against restrictions
* You receive the cure against spam

----

How it Works
-------------

:term:`Particl Marketplace` relies on open-source technologies that are openly audited, inspected, and improved by the global community. Each and every single component of the marketplace is designed to keep you, your funds, and your personal information safe.

It is based on distributed ledger and :term:`peer-to-peer <Peer-to-Peer>` technologies, which you may have heard when referred to as :term:`blockchain`, Bitcoin, or :term:`cryptocurrencies <cryptocurrency>`. It runs on a distributed network (:term:`Particl Network`) of :term:`nodes <Node>` hosted by volunteers scattered across the world. It is an entirely autonomous platform that doesn’t require any central party to operate, which means no company or organization gets in the middle of a transaction between a buyer and a seller.
