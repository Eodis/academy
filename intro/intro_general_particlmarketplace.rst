*-You will feel like a champion!*

Keep more money 
----------------

You know the desire to have the best food, ideally the healthy stuff? Another one is to have a decent home, ideally, one you are proud of. Not to forget, to have your body in the best possible physical and emotional shape. Additionally, to be in a good relationship with your loved ones and your communities. And finally, to be able to fulfill your dreams and give back the best you can.

**Your desire to survive and thrive in today’s economy is mainly bound to the state of your own finances.**

But did you know that, even if you use “free” platforms or services to buy and sell stuff, it is not really free? No, instead of paying with your money, you pay with your valuable data. 

|PM|, on the other hand, does not seek revenues from selling off your data or through fees. It doesn’t need that data and income because there are no corporate interests behind it. Instead, the Particl team is sponsored entirely by community donations and aims to become self-perpetual, but without compromising you.


*You will be able to save more or make more money by cutting out the middle-man*

Gain security
-------------

Big corporations collect data with your purchases and sales. The data is then utilized to evaluate you as a business owner or as a consumer. They then sell your data or use them against you in a way they can benefit without your knowledge or approval. A lot of times, this is done at your own detriment. Translated, this means:
 
**Corporations like e-commerce giants have become your credit score broker!**

* They will decide how high your insurance policy should be rated based on their risk assessment 
* Your personal preferences will be the reason why you may not get a particular job 
* Or even worse, a rating algorithm could block your accounts! 

Nothing less than your freedom and self-determination is put in jeopardy. The ever-growing-and-already-giant e-commerce corporations always seek to expand their profits, market power, and control. They have created today's very disturbing digital security and privacy crisis under the guise of usability and convenience.

*You will become in full control of your data and freedom*

**Get Rid of Fraud and Trickery**

No more bricks in the package for you as a customer or bad quality counterfeit goods. No more chargebacks for vendors due to stolen identities. Fraudulent attempts get taken down with a free of charge and automated two-party escrow system.

*You will become immune to online fraud*

**Get Rid of Invasion of Privacy or Backdoors** 

No more stolen credit card information, compromised email accounts, or any possibility of surveillance. When data is not created, it cannot be collected by anyone. It cannot be attained, shared, sold, misused, hacked, or leaked. Your data stays your data regardless whether it relates to your products, locations, payments, or any kind of online activity. And that’s true for both customers and vendors!

*You will become invincible to privacy issues*

**Get rid of Restrictions, Politics, and Malice**

A 100% uptime that is impossible to be taken offline or manipulated. It also means none of your products or users can be banned from the :term:`Particl Marketplace` or be censored by any governing body or legislation. Instead, the community remains in charge of the marketplace’s content at all times. Across national borders, free trade and free markets are possible so that manufacturers, vendors, and producers can freely decide how and with whom they do business.

*You will become bullet-proof against restrictions*

**Get Rid of Spam**

Tailored ads are hammering on you even after you have made a purchase, and most of the time, even before you make it. You have seen them on websites you visit, read them within your email accounts and apps you use. It even affects how search engines deliver results to you.

*You will have the cure against spam*

Enjoy giving back
-----------------

E-commerce and online marketplaces have made the world of shopping and selling a very different place. Small businesses have had to give up, while only a handful of large corporations continue to dominate the market. The price war is destroying small merchants, only to benefit Internet platforms and financial transaction providers. This also applies to all employees in the retail industry.

**It’s time to give back to the small, to the oppressed, to the exploited.**

How it works
-------------

With the award-winning |PM|, you first and foremost prioritize the security of your personal information and data. It is, simply put, the most secure and private online marketplace on the web.

It relies on open-source technologies that are openly audited, inspected, and improved by the global community. Each and every single component of the marketplace is designed to keep you, your funds, and your personal information safe.

However, |PM| is based on distributed ledger and :term:`peer-to-peer` technologies, which you may know by hearing Blockchain and Bitcoin's synonyms. It runs on a distributed network (:term:`Particl Network`) of :term:`nodes` hosted by volunteers scattered across the world. It is an entirely autonomous platform that doesn’t require any central party to operate, which means no company or organization is between buyers and sellers.
