Once, as children of a free world, we were taught what freedom, freedom of expression, and self-determination mean.

*It's about you–Everything but average.*

In The Need
-----------

**Who is in the need of a reliable trustless environment?**

Today's industrial orders across national borders are still problematic if there is no prior relationship of trust. The customers cannot be 100% sure to receive the goods in the type and quality they originally ordered. Likewise, suppliers have problems with in-full payments for their delivered goods. Too often, both parties remain with a loss of time, money, and confidence.

*Particl Marketplace is a viable option for commercial relationships.*

**Who is in the need for a privacy e-commerce platform?**

Unlike what you may think, there are very good reasons for that. In reality, it's nothing else than what we were used to since the beginning of cash. Today it helps with protection against spam and ends with journalists making deals with their sources. Not to forget the profound inplications which may arise regarding your credit score or insurance risk score. Furthermore, it's the foundation of help for the suffering audiences of oppression and blackmailing.

**Who is suffering from oppression and blackmailing in e-commerce?**

To date, this world still has regions where political oppression and censorship are the status quo. Their citizens are in dare need of a solution that delivers a way to do commerce in safety. On the other hand, all kinds of vendors across the board and regions get victims of hackers with various security and denial of service attacks (DDoS). 

**Customers or vendors without banking access**
