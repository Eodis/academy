Instead of using your usual internet shopping platforms, you almost casually defend essential core values for society with every purchase or sale on :term:`Particl Marketplace`. It’s about fairness for consumers, equal opportunity for merchants and vendors, and freedom for all people who disagree with the expansion of power and control from large corporations.

*It's about you–Everything but average.*

In Dire Need
------------

**Who needs a reliable trustless trade and commerce environment?**

Clients cannot be 100% sure to receive their goods in type and quality, which were formerly contractually agreed. Likewise, suppliers sometimes have problems with getting in-full payments for their delivered goods. These examples from the industrial business world show how orders across national borders are still problematic if there is no prior trust relationship. This contractual insecurity applies to almost any industry. Too often, both parties remain left behind with a loss of time, money, and confidence.

Another example is the not-so-known problem of exit-scam schemes where money gets put into third party escrow services in the deepest belief of a safe business transaction but with an unfortunate outcome.

*We help you to build, enable, and maintain trustless business to business (b2b), business to customer (b2c), and private peer to peer (p2p) e-commerce relationships. No prior solution before was free of charge and untouchable.*

**Who needs privacy in e-commerce?**

There are very good reasons for privacy in e-commerce. It's nothing more than what we've been used to since the dawn of cash, in commerce terms. Today, privacy helps protect you from spam and ends not only with a viable solution for journalists to do business with their sources. Furthermore, it ensures nobody can create a credit score or insurance risk score of you. 

Big e-commerce platforms actively invade their vendor's supply chains, put pressure on the suppliers, and then sell the vendors' intellectual property as products with their branding while suppressing the original vendor on their commerce platform.

*We help you to get back financial sovereignty. Commerce and financial transfers are yours and can't be turned into a weapon against you. You mind your business, and you are now able to protect it.*

**Who is suffering from oppression and blackmailing in e-commerce?**

To date, this world still has regions where political oppression and censorship are the status quo. Their citizens are in dare need of a solution that delivers a way to do commerce in safety. One can understand it as the equivalent of the human right of freedom of speech. 

On the other hand, all kinds of participants in e-commerce across the board of size and regions get victims of hackers with various security and denial of service attacks (DDoS). 

*We help you avoid fears and insecurities when you get threatened politically, governmental, by your competition or even hackers while you try doing business.*

**Who needs an e-commerce solution where no banking account is required?**

Believe it or not, 1.7 billion adult people on planet earth are unbanked. But you can bet they are interested in doing business, especially in their local area. Other than that, using services without banking is something that makes you special and undoubtedly independent.

*We help the unbanked society to do commerce, and you help to unbank yourself.*

**Who needs a backup plan for in-person deals?**

Surprising, but no too far fetched. An example would be buying a piece of jewelry from a person directly and making sure not to get scammed. Particl Marketplace's unique escrow system makes it possible, replaces the unsafe cash exchange and the uncertainty of not having a collateral in case something seems unfair. Now you have a kind of backup insurance.

*We help you to force your business partners to behave honestly and truthfully in online and offline deals.*


**Who needs a free of charge and free of operating costs e-commerce solution?**

While other "so-called" free e-commerce marketplaces and solutions take advantage of you hidden behind a myriad of fees which sum up to 40% per sale, or even worse, they live off your data, you identify this huge gap economically. The absence of operating costs encourages brands, vendors, suppliers, and even small retailers with their local business to thrive within an entirely self-sustaining and community-owned economy. The only operating costs you will see with Particl Marketplace are fighting off listing spam and unintentional usage. You just have found an interesting sales channel, potentially your new favorite.

*We help your business and your customers get the best deals while all participants become the owner of the marketplace itself.*

Just Economics
--------------

Driven by sensible economic reasons, customers and vendors seek the best deals out there. Remove corporate interest of a marketplace operator from the pricing model, and nearly anybody can comprehend the impact by doing the maths. Now, they can expand their motivations by participating in “just economics”.

Early-bird retailers, merchants, and vendors in general looking for new target customer groups, sales channels, and revenue streams will find exactly that. They’ll be able to offer their products at very competitive prices. At the same time, they get rid of many problems usually bound to limited trust setups and payment processing like instant payments without retention times or other made-up reasons to hold back their liquidity assets.

The absence of operating costs is another tidbit for any brand, any sales-driven endeavor, and makes it attractive even to co-operatives to set up their own and dedicated sales channel towards a bigger public audience or just towards a defined local VIP group of customers. Ultimately, it’s in the best of your interest to convince your existing customers to benefit from better prices. You take full advantage of the economic advancement for you as an individual, a collective, or as a business.

*We help you to reduce the cost of commerce to the minimum. It is about protecting your business and stimulating sustainable growth.*

To Take a Stand
---------------

As you may have noticed, the world is changing. More and more people do start to take a stand at multiple angles in society. 

For example, the sustainability movement pays special attention to not to waste resources and to protect them. Any resources. Some to name are agricultural products and their origins or adequately remunerated workforces, and of course the one resource that unites the all of us–Planet earth and its gems of life.

But there are also parties like the libertarians, a fairly sized community, having their very own interests. They do seek autonomy, political freedom, individualism and do question the current economic and political system. They care about our society like any other group, but with their own focus.

The list goes on with liberals and other dedicated interest groups that do have similar interests of the libertarian or sustainability movement, but that isn't doing justice to them if we put all of them into one bucket. We are talking about general opponents of surveillance, censorship, monopolies, banking but also just honest and caring people. 

It's a good idea to do the things you do carefully and purposefully, perhaps you'll find yourself the desire to take a stand or give back to society. You know best you don't fit into a generalized pigeonhole. All the philosophies do exist and have a right to exist.

*We help the caring society to take a stand and to express and achieve ideas of a better world.*
