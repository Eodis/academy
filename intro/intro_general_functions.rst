Particl Proof-of-Stake (Staking)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Staking is the action of keeping a :term:`node <Node>` online to support and secure Particl's distributed network. When you do so, you start receiving regular staking rewards paid by the network in exchange for your contribution.

- Earn dividend-like staking rewards in exchange for keeping Particl :term:`nodes <Node>` online.
- Staking interest on Particl varies between 2% and 5% depending on the percentage of the supply being put up for staking.
- The network gets more secure and resilient as more people stake.
- "Cold staking" is a hyper secure staking option that lets you delegate your staking power to an online :term:`node <Node>` that contains no coin. 
- Particl provides many different cold staking variants, each one being as secure as the other ones.
   - **Cold staking:** Stake your coins stored even when stored offline such as on cold wallets, hardware devices, or even paper wallets.
   - **Staking pool:** Combine your staking power with other stakers to earn more frequent payments.
   - **Hardware staking:** Stake your coins stored on hardware devices such as the Ledger Nano and the Trezor.
   - **Mobile staking:** Stake your coins stored on your phone without draining your battery.
   - **Multi-signature staking:** Stake your coins stored on special addresses that require multiple parties to authorize transactions.

In-depth details can be found at :ref:`Staking Explained`.

Address Book (Contacts)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Because funds need to be sent to cryptographic addresses, it can be hard to remember who owns which address. :term:`Particl Desktop`'s address book page is there specifically to help you make sense of these addresses by saving them to contacts.

- Save both public and private PART addresses and enter their contact information
- Display a contact's address and all of its details in a block explorer.

Two-Party Escrow System
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Particl's two-party escrow system protects users against scammers and ensures that marketplace transactions can be completed in a safe way. It requires both parties to temporarily lock a security deposit that can only be refunded, at no fee, once both parties agree that a transaction was completed satisfactorily. This forces transacting parties to remain honest with each other and collaborate in case an issue arises.

- Doesn't involve any middleman such as a third-party temporarily holding funds on behalf of transacting parties.
- Free to use, no fee is charged for the service.
- The escrow system is entirely autonomous and uses smart-contracts.
- All transactions made with the escrow system are untraceable by default and no personal information can leak out.
- Escrow transactions are secured by blockchain technology and cannot be interfered and tampered with.
- Two-party escrow contracts are mandatory for all marketplace transactions.
- You can check the status and progress of any escrow transaction at any time on :term:`Particl Desktop`.

In-depth details can be found at :ref:`Two-Party Escrow Explained`.

Marketplace Moderation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To moderate the content of the marketplace, Particl relies on a distributed moderation system that gives moderation powers to every user. Voting power is calculated on a one-coin-equals-one-vote basis.

- No central authority or group of users with special permissions involved.
- Your voting power is determined by the number of coins you own in your :guilabel:`Public` balance.
- One coins equals one vote.
- Both listings and community markets can be flagged and taken off Particl if deemed undesirable.

The feature is additionally integrated into any transaction allowing two users to publicly communicate in case there's an issue with an order.

- Ask a question, leave feedback, make comments, or ask for additional details on any listing's page.
