Payment Processing
------------------

This enables near-free, near-instant currency transactions that cannot be held up, blocked, reversed, or delayed by any party.

Fraud Protection
----------------

As a vendor or customer you equally hate it to fall victim of a scammer. The :term:`Particl Marketplace` uses an entirely new approach to make this impossible, which marks one of its unique selling propositions. Any purchase is secured by a two-party escrow system that doesn’t require any third-party to be involved.

Crowd Moderation
----------------

Since the :term:`Particl Marketplace` relies on a distributed network that doesn't grant any special power to anyone and the software isn't owned by anyone, the moderation of its content needs to be done differently. Particl relies on the “wisdom of the crowd” theory by giving every user the equal opportunity to flag and take off undesirable content. In other words, every user is a moderator.
