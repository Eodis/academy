General Usage and Concept
-------------------------

We aim at making Particl Marketplace as convenient as possible for you to use while making zero compromise on the core values of decentralization, security, privacy, and disintermediation at the same time. 

By nature, this is not always easy to do, but it's getting pretty darn good and it keeps on getting better at every new release.

Make sure you understand the basics and the rest will follow. In the meantime, if you spot any issue or want to give your feedback to help improve the platform, let us know!

.. note::

	A web and a mobile version of :term:`Particl Marketplace` are planned to be released later on and will play a key role in making the platform more accessible and convenient to use.

Payment Processing
------------------

Instead of relying on third-party payment processors, bank transfers, or payment cards, :term:`Particl Marketplace` uses digital currencies, commonly called :term:`cryptocurrencies <Cryptocurrency>`. They enable near-free, near-instant currency transactions that cannot be held up, blocked, reversed, or delayed by anyone.

An ever-growing list of digital currencies can be used to make payments on the :term:`Particl Marketplace`. However, to secure marketplace trades and keep their data private, the final settlement of any transaction is always made in "PART", Particl’s own :term:`cryptocurrency <Cryptocurrency>`.

.. note::

	Payments with local, national currencies (i.e., USD, EUR) is planned to be integrated later on and will play a key role in making the platform more accessible and convenient to use.

Fraud Protection
----------------

Regardless if you're a vendor or a customer, you equally hate falling victim to a scammer. And when you don't know the other person you're transacting with, then how can you be sure that they are honest?

Luckily for you, one of :term:`Particl Marketplace`'s unique selling proposition is how effectively it prevents e-commerce fraud from happening at no extra cost for you.

Any purchase you make is secured by a two-party escrow system that doesn’t require any third-party to be involved. It makes scamming nearly impossible so that you can be confident transacting with anyone.

Compared to other online shopping platforms, the process of completing a transaction in full requires three additional steps. That's because of them that you get all these security, privacy, and cost-effectiveness benefits.

These three additional steps are the only convenience compromises made over traditional marketplaces. Now compare this tradeoff to the benefits they get you, that's a pretty sweet deal!

.. note::

	We are constantly improving the software and its user experience. Eventually, we also want to get rid of these extra steps. Bear with us while we work on it!

----

Crowd Moderation
----------------

Because the :term:`Particl Marketplace` relies on a distributed network that doesn't give any special power to any user, the moderation of its content needs to be done differently.

Particl stays true to the value of decentralization by instead relying on the “wisdom of the crowd” theory. It gives every user the equal opportunity to flag and take off undesirable content. 

See something you think shouldn't be on the marketplace? Flag it! When enough people do the same, it will be taken off the marketplace. 

In other words, every user is a moderator!

We are working on exciting projects and features to help the Particl ecosystem thrive, and new features constantly make their ways on the platform.
