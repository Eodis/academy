   :description lang=en: Particl Marketplace is a marketplace with features that customers and vendors will love. Privacy first, censorship-resistant, responsible, and sustainable e-commerce.

The :term:`Particl Marketplace` is a decentralized marketplace, meaning that no third-party is required to facilitate transactions. There's no marketplace company, e-commerce service provider, internet server, payment processor, or even bank involved. Transactions happen directly between you and the other person. 

While that unlocks many benefits not possible with traditional marketplaces, it also means that the :term:`Particl Marketplace` behaves a bit differently. Don’t worry. It is pretty easy to use, but there are a few things you need to consider before you get started. Let’s go over them!

Currency Transactions
---------------------

Instead of relying on payment processors, bank transfers, or payment cards, :term:`Particl Marketplace` works using electronic currencies, commonly named as :term:`cryptocurrency <Cryptocurrency>`. This enables near-free, near-instant currency transactions that cannot be held up, blocked, reversed, or delayed by any party. While many different digital currencies can be used on the :term:`Particl Marketplace`, all marketplace's transactions are ultimately settled in PART, Particl’s own :term:`cryptocurrency <Cryptocurrency>`.

The in-depth guide :ref:`Currency (PART) Explained` will make you understand it in full.

Fraud protection
----------------

Every marketplace needs to have solutions in place to protect both its buyers and sellers from scammers.

On traditional marketplaces, this requires a third-party to hold payments on behalf of the involved parties. At the same time, a service is being provided, or a product is being shipped. This role is usually assumed by the marketplace operator itself (i.e. Amazon), a payment processor (i.e. Paypal, Visa), or third-party escrow services (i.e. bank). This “mediated” escrow solution works in most cases. There are a few downsides to it, such as higher costs due to the fees, biased decisions (such as the marketplace almost always ruling in favor of the buyer), deferred payouts, and nearly absent data security and user privacy for all users.

The :term:`Particl Marketplace` uses an entirely different approach. It secures transactions using a two-party escrow system that doesn’t require any third-party to be involved. 

The in-depth guide :ref:`Two-Party Escrow Explained` will give you deep knowledge about this achievement.

----

Crowd Moderation
----------------

Since the :term:`Particl Marketplace` relies on a distributed network that doesn't grant any special power to anyone, the moderation of its content needs to be done differently. After all, there is no support staff, moderator, or administrator that can single-handedly keep spam and undesirable content out of the marketplace. Instead, Particl relies on the “wisdom of the crowd” theory by giving every user the equal opportunity to flag and take off undesirable content. In other words, every user is a moderator.

Particl's marketplace moderation works using an upvote/downvote system. When you see a listing you think shouldn’t be on the marketplace, you can downvote and flag it as undesirable. 

The in-depth guide :ref:`Marketplace Moderation Explained` will give you deep knowledge about its mechanics.

Noteworthy Mentions
-------------------

There are various other considerations to keep in mind when using the :term:`Particl Marketplace`. What follows is a compilation of things to be aware of.

**Wallet Unlocking**

To receive orders or to complete order steps, the :term:`Particl Desktop` client needs to be unlocked. You will not receive any orders or get notifications on the progress of active orders if you keep your wallet locked. Mind the vault icon in the top-right status icons bar.

**Have Some Funds Different Privacy States**

PART Coin has multiple privacy states by design. It is generally recommended to keep a few PART coins in both your :guilabel:`Public` and :guilabel:`Anon` balances. Indeed, holding some funds in those balances will allow you to use all the features offered to you by the :term:`Particl Marketplace` and accelerate the workflow.

The brief introduction :ref:`Types of balances` gives you insight on that matter.

**Loading and Syncing Times**

Because the :term:`Particl Marketplace`'s content is hosted on distributed Networks for payments and data-exchange, the marketplace may take a few minutes to sync. It may take even a few more minutes to fully load all marketplace's listings. This is to be normally expected and will get much faster as the Particl team improves the marketplace.
