* `rst manual <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/index.html>`_
* `Learn everything and see examples <https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/intro/getting-started-with-sphinx.html>`_

.. note::
	
	Best practice is to `open Getting Started <https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/intro/getting-started-with-sphinx.html>`_ to see how things shall look like in the end. If you found your example click on ``Edit on Gitub`` in the top right corner. Finally click the ``raw`` version with github to see how the markup was realized.
