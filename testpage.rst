.. note::
	
	Best practice is to open `Getting Started: <https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/intro/getting-started-with-sphinx.html>` to see how things shall look like in the end. If you found your example click on ``Edit on Gitub`` in the top right corner. Finally click the ``raw`` version with github to see how the markup was realized.
