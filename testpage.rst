* `rst manual <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/index.html>`
* `Learn everything and see examples <https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/intro/getting-started-with-sphinx.html>`

.. note::
	
	Best practice is to open _Getting Started: https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/intro/getting-started-with-sphinx.html to see how things shall look like in the end. If you found your example click on ``Edit on Gitub`` in the top right corner. Finally click the ``raw`` version with github to see how the markup was realized.


Testing ground
