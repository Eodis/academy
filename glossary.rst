   Sphinx
		Sphinx is a tool that makes it easy to create intelligent and beautiful documentation. It was originally created for the Python documentation and it has excellent facilities for the documentation of software projects in a range of languages.

   Decentralized Network
		A decentralized network is a distributed network that runs autonomously. It doesn't rely on central server or database. Each participant of a decentralized network contributes to its well-being. Any communication, exchange of data, or trade is done directly between each user of the platform without any central authority facilitating the exchange. 

   Peer-to-Peer
		Peer-to-peer (P2P) communication means two users can communicate with each other without requiring any intermediary assistance (i.e. servers, database, host, etc). 

   Node
		A node is an individual device connected to a decentralized network such as a computer, VPS, or mobile phone. Each node contributes in maintaining, supporting, securing, and verifying the integrity of a decentralized network. These tasks are automatically done by the node itself with little to no input required from the people running the nodes. Most users of a decentralized network access it through a node, whether that be directly (i.e. using one's own computer) or through a third-party node (i.e. service provider).

   Cryptocurrency
		Cryptocurrencies are digital units of a currency that can be transferred person-to-person without requiring a third-party (payment processor) to facilitate transactions. It enables near-free, near-instant currency transactions that cannot be held up, blocked, reversed, or delayed by any party.

   Particl

		Particl is the brand of a decentralized network built using blockchain and P2P technologies. Depending on the context, "Particl" is used liberally to describe various of the decentralized network's components which includes a cryptocurrency, a decentralized marketplace, and other components. Its core values are as follows:

   Particl Project
		The Particl Project refers to all combined efforts, people, and community contributing to the development, maintenance, promotion, and adoption of the Particl decentralized network. It is often simply referred to as "Particl" as well, depending on the context.

   Particl Blockchain
		The Particl Blockchain is a decentralized, immutable, and censorship-proof ledger. It is based on bitcoin technology and has been carefully enhanced by the Particl team to provide a more robust level of privacy through industry-leading privacy technologies. The Particl Blockchain processes and validates payments between two users without requiring any third-party such as a bank or a payment processor.

   SecureMessaging (SMSG)
		SecureMessaging (SMSG protocol) is a decentralized storage network (DSN) to store and transfer data between nodes in a privacy-preserving manner. It enables a private and secure environment for e-commerce and communications between users. SMSG powers the Particl Marketplace without bloating the blockchain with excessive data and without leaving any permanent record.

   Particl Core
		Particl Core is the software providing a direct connection to the Particl decentralized network. It provides users with all the functions and features of the Particl blockchain. It also acts as a gateway to allow applications to interact directly with the blockchain. Because it runs silently in the background of your computer, Particl Core may often be referred to as a daemon or "particld".

		Users can easily interact with Particl Core by either using its CLI client (commands on a terminal) or its graphical counterpart Particl-Qt.

   Particl Marketplace
		The Particl Marketplace is a decentralized marketplace that allows two users to buy and sell anything from each other without the assistance of any third-party (i.e. bank, payment processor, centralized marketplace, etc). It is Particl's flagship application and provides much more privacy, security, and freedom than typical marketplaces. Since it is decentralized, it charges no sales commission and other similar types of fees. 

   Particl's Open Market Protocol (OMP)
		The OMP is the back-end protocol that makes the Particl Marketplace possible. It is the framework that defines how marketplace transactions, orders, listings, and other key eCommerce functionalities are to be processed by the SMSG network and the Particl Blockchain. It is the "glue" that sticks everything together. If Particl Desktop is what people use to access the marketplace (the front end), the OMP is what makes it possible in the background (the back-end). `Open Market Protocol - wiki link <https://particl.wiki/learn/marketplace/open-market-protocol/>`_

   Particl Desktop
		Particl Desktop is the main client of the Particl Project and is a user-friendly interface into the Particl network. It is the main point of access into the Particl ecosystem and lets users complete all basic activities one would expect to do on Particl. This includes making cryptocurrency transactions, using the Particl Marketplace, sending messages to other users, and so on. 

   Particl SDK
		The Particl Software Development Kit (SDK) is a set of tools and documentation that enables independent developers to contribute to the Particl Ecosystem (any of its software, product, or service). It's purpose is to speed up the onboarding process of independent developers and streamline all the tools and knowledge they need to acquire to get started.

   Particl Bots
		Particl Bots are Particl Desktop functionalities provided by third-parties. As these services are not decentralized, they are not activated by default and need to be manually enabled by the user. Particl Bots can have various purposes, most of the time related to a service, such as providing cryptocurrency exchange capabilities, providing data (i.e. cryptocurrency prices), payment integrations, and etc.
