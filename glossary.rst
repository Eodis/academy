The Particl glossary
====================

.. glossary:: :sorted:

   Sphinx
      Sphinx is a tool that makes it easy to create intelligent and beautiful documentation. It was originally created for the Python documentation, and it has excellent facilities for the documentation of software projects in a range of languages.

   Particl Desktop
		Describes the multi-purpose Desktop Application capable of hosting multiple functionalities at once and delivering a streamlined user-experience when interacting with its services and applications. It runs the Particl Blockchain and the SMSG protocol, hosts Particl Coin related wallets, gives users access to the Particl Marketplace as well as the encrypted chat application. Additionally, Particl Desktop supports a bot-framework to integrate interactions with 3rd party services within a user-friendly interface. Particl Desktop is generally referred to as Particl’s flagship application.

   Particl Core 
		Describes the software delivering the bare-minimum functionalities for interacting with the Particl Network. The software includes a daemon (a resident program running in the background of the computer) called particld running the Particl Blockchain and the Particl SecureMessaging protocol. Furthermore, it includes a command-line interface (CLI) for interacting with the daemon. Finally, it also has a graphical user interface (GUI; based on the QT GUI development toolkit) wallet for a more user-friendly interaction with the daemon. Some Particl applications do provide their own Particl Core to ensure a seamless and independent user-experience. 

   Particl Open Marketplace Protocol
		Describes a framework to process e-commerce transactions on the Particl Network. It is the e-commerce backbone of the Particl Project and utilizes the Particl Network. The Particl Open Marketplace Protocol (OMP - Open Marketplace Protocol) is a formal description of how standardized inputs and outputs can be consumed and processed by any application. The protocol allows a cross-client integration of Particl Technology and serves as a standard for privacy-preserving e-commerce.

   Particl Platform
		Describes the whole software foundation any Particl Application builds on.

   Particl SDK
		Particl SDK (Software Development Kit) describes a set of tools and extensive documentation to enable independent developers to contribute to the Particl Codebase and to kickstart their software additions to different Particl Applications or create their Applications as an addition to the Particl Ecosystem.

   Particl Bots
		Describes a standardized snap-in functionality within the Particl Desktop client software to enable 3rd parties to offer their services in exchange for PART and automating tasks within Particl Desktop client. 
 
		Note: The automation portion is a subject of future development. Meanwhile, the functionality is as best to describe as a bridge. But since the final vision and purpose is automation, the naming Bots is fine.

   Particl Ecosystem
		It describes the whole of any value or participant within the Particl Project economic cycle. Anything or anybody contributing or utilizing Particl’s economic model (Particl Coin) or any other Particl Application is a part of it. 

   Particl Foundation
		Describes a swiss based non-profit legal entity serving the Particl Ecosystem. 

   Particl Network
		The Particl Network consists of two technologies: 

		1. The Particl Blockchain is a decentralized and immutable ledger, based on bitcoin technology but carefully enhanced by the Particl Developers with industry-leading privacy technology. The Particl Blockchain secures and testifies payments, the exchange of value in a decentralized way without the need for any banking system.

		2. Secondly, a data-layer named Particl SecureMessaging (SMSG protocol) which is utilized as a decentralized storage network (DSN) to transfer data between nodes in a privacy-preserving manner. Particl SecureMessaging enables a privacy-proof environment for e-commerce with Particl Marketplace and communications between users without bloating the Blockchain and leaving permanent records.
