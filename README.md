If you want to contribute to the Academy as a power contributor follow this [tutorial](https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/docs/install_and_contrib.html). It will save you from a lot of headaches and lost time equally. You will learn a bit about Git, Github, repositories, and how to render a local HTML copy of the Academy and how to push your edits into the live version.
