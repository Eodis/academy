# Particl Academy

If you are an occasional contributor and you only want to add one or two lines, or fix some typos, hit the `Edit` button under `Github` in the bottom left corner where it says `Read the Docs` on the [Academy website](https://academy.particl.io), it will serve you well without bloat.

If you want to contribute to the Academy as a power contributor follow this [tutorial](https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/docs/install_and_contrib.html). It will save you from a lot of headaches and lost time equally. You will learn a bit about Git, Github, repositories, and how to render a local HTML copy of the Academy and how to push your edits into the live version.  

The Particl Academy documentation is based on Read the Docs. Content is written in RestfulText.
