Staking Explained
=================

"Staking" refers to the act of supporting the network by validating transactions and receiving a reward from the network in exchange. It this, simply put, earning coins for keeping a connection to the Particl network active.

When staking, your computer (referred to as a "staking node") helps the network by validating transactions. It is a crucial task to ensure the security of the network, but it is fully automated and doesn't require you to do anything special. In exchange for the work provided by your staking node, the Particl network pays you an interest in dividend-like payments proportional to the number of PART coins you own in your public balance. This interest rate varies between 2% to 5% per year based on a few factors.

To guarantee the integrity of the network, all staking nodes process all the transactions on Particl. To verify the integrity of these transactions, staking nodes compare the processed data with each other and only validate transactions when the information is identical across a majority of the other nodes. 

If the data of a transaction cannot be confirmed by enough staking nodes on the network, the transaction is collectively rejected. This mechanism is what is generally referred to as a consensus mechanism.

Particl Proof-of-Stake (PPoS)
-----------------------------

To support its network and verify its transactions, Particl uses Particl Proof-of-Stake (PPoS), a unique Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism designed by the Particl team. Unlike Bitcoin's Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism, which is secured by costly and electricity hungry "mining" machines, Particl makes the entire process of verifying transactions digital.

Every online user is a staking node that verifies the integrity of the network in real-time. When a staker finds a transaction block and validates the transactions it contains with the rest of the network, they receive a staking reward.

While the Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism isn't particularly new, Particl has been pioneering the technology by making it much more flexible, secure, and also private. Indeed, PPoS is packed with several leading edge capabilities that let you effortlessly reap all the benefits of Proof-of-Stake, but without any of its typical security and convenience concessions.

PPoS Quick Facts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Yearly staking interest paid in dividend-like payments.
- Redistributes all marketplace fees to stakers.
- Modern and rock solid staking security.
- Adjustable level of privacy available.
- No minimum number of PART coins required to receive staking rewards.

Earn Passive Income
-------------------

Staking on Particl can be a great source of passive income. In fact, just by keeping your :term:`Particl Desktop` client connected to the internet, you automatically earn a yearly interest of 2% to 5% on the PART coins held in your public balance. In other words, the more PART coins you own, the more PART coins you earn. Simple enough, right?

.. tip:: 
   If you stake enough PART coins, your staking rewards could pay for the entirety of your listing fees! 

What's a staking reward?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A staking reward is defined as any number of PART coins received from the Particl network in exchange for securing it. These rewards are proportionally paid to stakers in exchange for their contribution in securing the network and validating transactions. This process is entirely automatic and happens in the background without you requiring to do any manual task.

How much can I earn?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As a general rule of thumb, you can calculate that you'd be able to earn an interest rate of 2% to 5% on the PART coins you hold in your public balance. However, the variability and unpredictibility of certain factors makes it impossible to tell exactly how much you will earn staking on Particl. 

If staking 24/7, you are guaranteed to earn at least 2% per year in staking interest on the coins held in your public balance. But that's only if 100% of the coins in circulation are being staked by their owners. 

In reality, only about 35% to 55% of the coins in circulation are staked at any time, which means staking rewards get redistributed among a smaller pool of stakers. This directly translates to stakers receiving staking rewards more often, which leads to the actual yearly staking interest rate to be higher than the guaranteed minimum of 2%. 

Secondly, the size of a single staking reward (the number of coins it contains) varies greatly depending on two additional factors.

- **Marketplace fees:** All the fees generated by the marketplace are redistributed to stakers. While Particl is a near-zero cost marketplace, sellers still need to pay a fee to list products, create markets/storefronts and promote them. And because there is no central entity owning the rights to that income, it is proportionally redistributed back to the stakers by using the staking rewards as the distribution mode. This also applies to any future marketplace feature that would require a fee to be paid by the user.

- **Transaction fees:** When sending PART coins to someone or into a marketplace escrow contract, a small transaction fee needs to be paid to the network. This fee is usually just a few cents, or even less, but it's more than enough to fight off spam and pay stakers. All PART transaction fees are added to staking rewards and redistributed back to stakers. 

While there are online calculators giving estimates on the staking revenue of many :term:`cryptocurrencies`, it's important to keep in mind that they do not take into account factors such as marketplace and transaction fees or even the percentage of coins on a network being put up for staking. This usually makes their estimates less reliable.

Network effect
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The more people use Particl, the bigger the staking rewards get. That's because the increase in activity on the platform directly leads to more fees being paid by people. And since all the fees paid to the Particl network are redistributed back to stakers, it creates a self-fulfilling environment that rewards you for getting more people to use Particl more often.

The other interesting dynamic of Particl's staking economy is that you receive more staking rewards when less coins are available for staking. That's because the same staking interest has to be distributed among a smaller pool of coins. More rewards per coin.

As a contributing factor, you can only earn staking interest on the coins you hold in a public balance. Coins held in blind and anon balances cannot earn staking rewards, although they do fulfil other needs within the Particl ecosystem. And as the marketplace requires the use of anon balances, less coins are available for staking when more people use it.

Additionally, all marketplace transactions are automatically secured by a two-party escrow system that requires two security deposits and the full payment for a product to be temporarily locked. That, too, makes a lot of PART coins unable to be put up for staking.

In simpler words, the more people that use Particl, the more staking rewards you earn!

Staking Options
---------------

PPoS is a modern and very flexible Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism. Its most unique and groundbreaking feature is the ability to delegate your coin's staking power to a separate staking node that contains no coin. Not only does it provides you with the most secure staking solution available anywhere, it also unlocks a ton of ways you can stake your PART coins, each with its own benefits and considerations.

Regular staking
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Pros**

- Can be activated effortlessly.
- Activated by default on clients not protected by a password.

**Cons**

- Your :term:`Particl Desktop` password is stored in your computer's memory.
- You need to keep your computer online 24/7.

Arguably the easiest way to start staking is to keep the :term:`Particl Desktop` application open. This requires you to "unlock your wallet for staking only", which means your :term:`Particl Desktop` client will act as a staking node and be able to verify transactions. This simple way of staking doesn't use Particl's novel ability to delegate your coin's staking power to another node, and for this reason, is a bit limited.

Regular staking requires a constant and active network connection, which means you need to keep your computer online at all time. It also cannot really be effectively implemented on external devices due to the constant network requirement, huge battery drainage, and security vulnerabilities. 

Cold staking
^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Pros**

- Very secure staking option.
- The wallet containing your coins doesn't need to be online at any time.
- Very flexible, it allows many other staking options.

**Cons**

- You need to set up and maintain an external staking node and keep it online 24/7.
- The setup process is a bit more technically advanced.

Cold staking is the better, more modern staking solution brought by Particl. It lets you delegate your coin's staking power to an external staking node without having to keep your Particl wallet online.

That means you can store your coins in a cold wallet, a hardware device (i.e. a Ledger Nano device), a cloud server, or even a simple piece of paper, and still be able to earn staking rewards on those coins even though they are completely offline. It grants you with the maximum amount of security and adds a ton of flexibility not available with most PoS solutions.

**Note:** The staking node's sole purpose is to stake PART coins held on external addresses. It doesn't store any coin at all. For this reason, hosting a staking node on an untrusted environment (i.e. a server provider) or device (i.e. any computer) is entirely secure and will not put your PART coins at risk of being stolen.

Staking pools
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Pros**

- Can be activated effortlessly.
- Very secure staking option.
- The wallet containing your coins doesn't need to be online at any time.
- Pays more frequent staking rewards.

**Cons**

- You need to pay a staking pool fee (a percentage on your staking revenue).

To earn more frequent but smaller rewards, you can team up with other stakers by joining a staking pool and combine your staking power. Whenever the pool validates a block with the full staking power of all its stakers, it receives a staking reward. All of the staking rewards collected by the pool are then proportionally redistributed to its members according to their contribution to the pool's staking power. In other words, if you stake in a staking pool and own 10% of all its staking power, then you will receive 10% of all its staking revenue, minus the pool fee.

Staking pools are safe to use as the pool operator cannot run away with any of the staker's funds. It is ideal if you hold a small number of PART coins. It's also super convenient as it can be set up in just under a minute and doesn't require you to set up an external staking node cold staking does.

.. tip:: 
   You can use a staking pool instead of a staking node to enable mobile and hardware staking.

Hardware Staking
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Pros**

- Most secure staking option.
- The wallet containing your coins doesn't need to be online at any time.

**Cons**

- You need to set up a staking node and keep it online 24/7, unless you use a staking pool instead.
- The setup process is the most complicated of all staking options on Particl.

For an even more secure staking solution, you can stake PART coins stored on hardware wallets such as the Ledger Nano S or the Trezor. These hardware devices are super secure :term:`cryptocurrency` wallets that require a direct physical access to authorize any transaction. They are "hacker-proof" devices that protect you against viruses, infected computers, compromised internet connections, and etc.

And since PPoS is a highly flexible protocol, it doesn't penalize you for going "security first". It lets you enable staking and earn staking interest on all of your coins stored in you hardware wallet.

Mobile staking
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Pros**

- Very secure staking option.
- The wallet containing your coins doesn't need to be online at any time.

**Cons**

- You need to set up a staking node and keep it online 24/7, unless you use a staking pool instead.

As its name implies, mobile staking lets you earn a staking interest on the PART coins held on your mobile phone. This functionality uses cold staking to delegate your coin's staking power to another node. Because your phone isn't doing the actual staking work (that's the role of the delegated staking node), it doesn't create any battery drainage issue and doesn't require you to keep your phone always unlocked. It also won't bust your mobile data as it uses no extra resources. It is a convenient staking solution that lets you carry your coins wherever you go and still earn staking interest on them. 

Multi-signature staking
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In :term:`cryptocurrency`, multi-signature addresses are addresses collectively owned by many people. To authorize a transaction, a certain number of signatures is required by an address' owners. For example, a "2-of-3 multi-signature address" is a :term:`cryptocurrency` address collectively owned by three people. Two out of the three owners need to sign a transaction for it to be executed.

Multi-signature staking does precisely what its name says. It lets you earn staking rewards on the coins held in multi-signature addresses. Just like staking pools and mobile staking, this functionality is made possible thanks to PPoS's ability to delegate staking powers to other nodes.

Privacy
-------

By default, Particl Proof-of-Stake distributes its staking rewards using public transactions. For this reason, the process of distributing staking rewards is completely transparent and auditable. This is a huge boost in trust and security for the network as any potential malfunction or coin generating exploit would be instantly detected right at the source. 

However, it also means anyone can trace all staking rewards and look right into your wallet. Not something you would want to happen with your bank account. 

Luckily, Particl allows you control your level of staking privacy. To do so, you need to indicate to the network that you'd like to receive your staking rewards in another type of balance other than your public balance. Check out the :doc:`staking guide <../guides/guide_mp_general_enable_staking>` to see how to do it.
