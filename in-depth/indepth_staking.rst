Staking
=======

**Earn coins just by leaving Particl open!**

"Staking" refers to the action of keeping a node online to support the network and verify the interity of its transactions. Each node processes all the transactions that happen on Particl. To verify their integrity, the node compares the data with other nodes connected to the network and only validates transactions when the information is identical on all nodes. If the data of a transaction cannot be confirmed by other nodes on the network, the transaction is rejected. This is what is generally referred to as a **consensus mechanism**.

Particl Proof-of-Stake (PPoS)
-----------------------------

To support the network and verify transactions, Particl uses Particl Proof-of-Stake (PPoS), a unique Proof-of-Stake **consensus mechanism**. Unlike with Bitcoin's Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism which requires users (miners) to secure the network by using costly dedicated machines, Particl makes the entire process virtual and cost-free. 

Every online user is a node that verifies the integrity of the transactions happening in real-time on the network. These people are referred to as **stakers**. To guarantee they reach the right consensus, stakers are required to put funds at stake on the network by locking PART coins as "insurance" that they will behave honestly. When a staker finds a transaction block that is also validated by the rest of the network, a staking reward is awarded.

While Proof-of-Stake protocols are not new to the blockchain world, Particl has been at the forefront of its innovations. PPoS is packed with several security and utility benefits that lets you effortlessly reap the benefits of staking without any of its typical security risks.

PPoS Quick Facts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

	- Staking rewards are distributed as dividend-like payments.
	- All transaction and marketplace fees paid on Particl are redistributed back to stakers.
	- Industry-leading staking security.
	- Adjustable level of privacy available.
	- No minimum number of PART coins required to receive rewards.

Earn Passive Income
-------------------

.. tip:: 
   Did you know that if you hold enough PART coins in your wallet, your staking rewards could pay for the entirety of your listing fees? 

Staking on Particl can be a great source of passive income. In fact, just by keeping your Particl Desktop client connected to the internet, you automatically earn an interest on the funds you hold in your wallet. The more PART coins you own, the more PART coins you can earn. The rewards are regularly distributed in dividend-like payments whenever your client finds finds a transaction block.

What's a staking reward?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A staking reward is defined as any number of PART coins received from the Particl network. These rewards are **proportionally** paid to stakers in exchange for their contribution in securing the network and validating transactions. This process is entirely automatic and happens in the background without you requiring to do any manual tasks.

If staking 24/7, you are **guaranteed to earn at least 2% yearly interest** on your PART coins. How much you actually earn depends on multiple factors, but it's almost always going to be higher than the guaranteed 2% rate.

For one, the minimum interest rate of 2% assumes that 100% of the coins in circulation would be locked for staking. In reality, only about 40% to 55% is usually being reserved for staking, which means staking rewards get redistributed among a smaller pool of stakers. This directly translates to stakers receiving staking rewards more often, which increases the base rate of 2% per rate. 

Secondly, the size of single staking reward can vary greatly depending on three main factors. Bigger than usual staking rewards can rapidly lead to a much higher staking rate of 2% per year.

- **Inflation of the supply:** The Particl network has a scheduled inflation of 2% per year. That means the total number of PART coins in circulation increases 2% every year. The creation process of these new coins is spread out evenly throughout a year in blocks of 2 minutes. In other words, a small number of PART coins is created and paid to a staker every 2 minutes. 

- **Marketplace fees:** While Particl is a near-zero cost marketplace, sellers still need to pay a fee to list products, create markets or promote them. And because there is no central entity owning the rights to that income, it is entirely redistributed back to the stakers. This also applies to any future marketplace feature that would require a fee to be paid by the user.

- **Transaction fees:** When sending PART coins to someone or into a marketplace escrow contract, a small transaction fee needs to be paid to the network. This fee is usually just a few cents, or less, but it's more than enough to fight off spam and give a good reason for stakers to contribute in securing the network. 

How much can I earn? (online calculator)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It's impossible to tell exactly how much you could earn staking on Particl. That's because the factors mentioned above can quickly and unpredictably change. It is, however, possible to estimate approximately how much you could earn.

Network effect
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**The more people use Particl, the bigger the staking rewards get**. That's because the increase in activity on the platform directly leads to more fees being paid by people. And since all the fees paid to the Particl network are redistributed back to the stakers, it creates a self-fulfilling environment that rewards you for getting more people to use Particl more often.

What's more, you can only stake your PART coins when they're stored on public balances. And since you need to hold coins on anon balances to buy and sell products and services on the marketplace, more marketplace users also mean less coins available for staking. T

Staking is at the very core of Particl's economy and viral network effect potential.

Staking Options
---------------

PPoS is a modern and very flexible Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism. Its most unique and groundbreaking feature is the ability to delegate your coin's staking power to an online node that contains no coin. Not only does it provides you with the most secure staking solution available anywhere, it also unlocks a ton of ways you can stake your PART coins, each with its own benefits and considerations

Regular staking
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Arguably the easiest way to start staking is to keep Particl open. This requires you to "unlock your wallet for staking only", which means your Particl node will be able to verify transactions but still be locked if you or someone else attempts to make any transaction. It doesn't use Particl's novel ability to delegate your coin's staking power to another node.

While this form of staking is easy to setup, it is not the most convenient. It requires a constant and active network connection, which means you need to keep your computer online at all time. It also cannot really be effectively implemented on mobile wallets due to the constant network requirement and huge battery drainage. 

Staking this way also introduces a small vulnerability as the password of your Particl Desktop client has to remain stored in your computer's memory. Don't worry, even if someone steals your laptop, it's more than likely that they won't be able to extract the password. But over a potentially long period of time, extremely skilled hackers might be able to find non Particl related exploits to extract the content of your laptop's memory.

Cold staking
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Cold staking is the better, more modern staking solution. Simply put, it refer to the action of staking PART coins held offline. This includes funds held in cold wallets, hardware devices (i.e. a Ledger Nano device), or even paper wallets. It grants you with the maximum amount of security and even add a ton of flexibility not available with most PoS solutions.

More precisely, it lets you delegate your coin's staking power to an online node that contains no coin. This means you could go as far as generate a PART address offline, write its seed on a piece of paper, and bury it at the bottom of the sea, you'd still be receiving your staking interest. And even if a hacker were to ever get access to the delegated staking node, all they'd be able to steal is 0 PART, which would be the balance of the staking node.

Staking pools
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To earn more frequent but smaller rewards, you can team up with other stakers by joining a staking pool and combine your staking power. Whenever the pool validates a block and receives a staking reward, it is proportionally distributed to the members of the pool. In other words, if you stake in a staking pool and own 10% of all the coins in that pool, then you will receive 10% of all the pool's staking revenue.

Staking pools are safe to use as the pool operator cannot run away with any of the staker's funds. It is ideal if you hold a small number of PART coins. It's also super convenient as it can be set up in just under a minute and doesn't require you to set up a separate Particl node like is required with cold staking. 


Mobile staking
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As its name implies, mobile staking lets you earn a staking interest on the PART coins held on your mobile phone. This functionality uses cold staking to delegate your coin's staking power to another node. Because your phone isn't doing the actual staking work (that's the role of the delegated staking node), it doesn't create any battery drainage issue and doesn't require you to keep your wallet unlocked for staking. It is a convenient staking solution that lets you carry PART coins wherever you go without punishing you with the inability to earn staking interest.

Multi-signature staking
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In cryptocurrency, multi-signature addresses are addresses collectively owned by many people. To authorize a transaction, a certain number of signatures is required. For example, a "2-of-3 multi-signature address" is a cryptocurrency address collectively owned by three people. Two out of the three owners need to sign a transaction for it to be executed.

Multi-signature staking does precisely what its name says. It lets you earn staking rewards on the coins held in multi-signature addresses. Just like staking pools and mobile staking, this functionality is made possible thanks to PPoS's ability to delegate staking powers to other nodes.


Privacy
-------

Particl Proof-of-Stake distributes its staking rewards using public transactions. For this reason, the process of distributing staking rewards is completely transparent and auditable. This is a huge boost in security for the network as any potential malfunction or coin generating exploit would be instantly detected right at the source.

However, if you desire to remain anonymous, you can use Particl's private script to change in which balance you receive your staking rewards. You could, for example, request your staking rewards to be received in your anon balance so that they remain untraceable to the rest of the network.
