Staking Specifications
----------------------     

Particl uses the Particl Proof-of-Stake (PPoS) protocol which gives you back an interest on your funds in regular dividend-like payments in exchange for keeping nodes online. It also offers highly secure staking options that lets you stake all of your funds without sacrificing an ounce of security. 

Particularly, Particl's "cold staking" mechanism allows you to earn interest on your PART coins even if they're stored offline on a cold wallet, a hardware device (i.e. Ledger Nano), a phone, or even just a piece of paper. To receive rewards more often, you can also team up with other stakers by participating in a cold staking pool.
