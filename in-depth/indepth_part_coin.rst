PART Cryptocurrency
===================

Although you can use many different coins to pay for products and services on Particl's marketplace, payments are ultimately settled in PART. 

PART is an untraceable cryptocurrency that can be sent to anyone, anywhere in the world, without the need for any third-party to facilitate transactions. It is a secure cryptocurrency that is similar to Bitcoin, but packed with better tools to help you preserve your financial privacy from prying eyes. The PART coin is one of the major pieces of the Particl puzzle that protects your personal information when using the marketplace.

Staking Specifications
----------------------     

Particl uses the Particl Proof-of-Stake (PPoS) protocol which gives back interest on your funds in the form of regular dividend-like payments in exchange for securing the network by keeping Particl nodes online. It also offers highly secure staking options that lets you stake all of your funds without sacrificing an ounce of security. 

Particularly, Particl's "cold staking" mechanism allows you to earn interest on your PART coins even if they're stored offline on a cold wallet, a hardware device (i.e. Ledger Nano), a phone, or even just a piece of paper. To receive rewards more often, you can also team up with other stakers by participating in a cold staking pool.
