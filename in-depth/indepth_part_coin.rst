Blockchain Specifications
-------------------------

**PART is the cryptocurrency of the Particl blockchain**. It is a secure and confidential currency specifically designed to power a marketplace. It uses several security, encryption, and privacy protocols to make sure none of your personal information and data can be collected when transacting on the marketplace. 

PART has been released back in 2017 and is based on the Bitcoin code. Unlike Bitcoin, many modern day improvements have been added to the code, making it faster, more private, and more flexible.

Staking Specifications
----------------------     

Particl uses the Particl Proof-of-Stake (PPoS) consensus mechanism which pays back interest in dividend-like payments to **stakers** in exchange for securing the network. PPoS offers many secure staking options that lets you effortlessly reap the benefits of staking without any of its typical security risks.

In particular, Particl's **cold staking** mechanism allows you to earn an interest on the PART coins you own even when they're stored offline. That also includes funds stored on a cold wallet, a hardware device (i.e. Ledger Nano), a phone, or even just a piece of paper. Cold staking also lets you earn rewards more often by teaming up with other stakers. This is done by joining a **staking pool**.

Types of balances
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

On Particl, there are three different types of balance, each with its own purpose, cost, level of privacy, and settings. All three types of balance is available on Particl Desktop and you can easily convert coins from one type of balance to another by reading the :doc:`Manage Funds user guide <guides/guide_mp_general_managing_funds>`.

Public Balance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **Cost:** Extremely low
- **Marketplace use:** Pay for listing fees and determine your voting power (moderation)
- **Privacy:** Fully transparent and auditable, transacting amounts and parties are publicly available

Public balances lets you make Bitcoin-like public transactions. These transactions are the cheapest ones to make, but they're also the most simple ones to process. For this reason, they are the most widely supported type of transaction by exchanges and third-party services. 

**What can you do with public balances and transactions?**

	- Send and receive basic and cheap payments.
	- Earn PART coins by earning staking rewards.
	- Pay for listing fees on the marketplace.
	- Participate in the marketplace's moderation system.
	- Create proposals and cast votes.
	- Use smart-contracts.

Blind Balance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **Cost:** Low
- **Marketplace use:** Part of the background requirement of Particl's two-party escrow system
- **Privacy:** Confidential, transacting amounts are not publicly available

Blind balances offer a significant step-up in privacy. Based on the work of the open-source `Elements Project <https://elementsproject.org/features/confidential-transactions/investigation>`_, they let you make blinded transactions that keep the value of the payment private between you and the other party you're transacting with. Who's participating in a blinded transaction is still publicly available, but it's impossible for anyone not involved in it to see what the value of the payment is. 

**What can you do with blind balances and transactions?**

	- Send and receive confidential transactions.
	- Use confidential smart-contracts (transacted amounts hidden).
	- Enable anonymous smart-contracts.

Anon Balance
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **Cost:** Moderate
- **Marketplace use:** Purchase and sell goods and services
- **Privacy:** Anonymous, transacting amounts and parties are not publicly available

By adding "ring signatures" to blind balances, you obtain anon balances, the highest level of privacy on Particl. Not only does it make transactions confidential, it makes them entirely untreaceable. What this means is that both the transacting amounts and parties remain private. Who you transact with and how much you're transacting can only be known by you and that other person.

**What can you do with anon balances and transactions?**

	- Send and receive untraceable transactions.
	- Pay for goods and services on Particl's marketplace.
	- Use anonymous smart-contracts
	- Participate in two-party escrow transactions without sharing your information to any third-party.
