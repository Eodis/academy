Characteristics
---------------

While the :term:`Particl Marketplace` is an easy-to-use e-commerce platform, what happens in the background is relatively complex and employs several brand new technologies. There's no server, central database, or employees working at keeping the marketplace up and running. Instead, it relies on an intricate combination of distributed technologies developed, maintained, and run by a vast and global network of participants.

* **Autonomous**—runs by itself and requires no human intervention
* **Secure**—the highest level of digital security provided by trustless encryption
* **Private**—no data or personal information collected about you
* **Resilient**—can’t be censored, hacked, or shut down by anyone
* **Censorship-proof**—no predefined rules or policies, and no ban on items
* **Near-zero fee**—only pay the bare minimum for the network to run by itself

These advantages are only possible thanks to the particularly :term:`decentralized <Decentralization>` nature of the :term:`Particl Marketplace`.

----

Technicals in a Nutshell
------------------------

:term:`Particl Marketplace` is an add-on application of the :term:`Particl Desktop` client software. The marketplace uses Particl's :ref:`Open Market Protocol (OMP)` for communications with the :term:`Particl Network`, which is the :term:`decentralized <Decentralization>` backbone for payments, messaging, and signaling. 

The :term:`Particl Network` consists of the :term:`Particl Blockchain` to execute and verify financial transactions with its independent :ref:`PART Coin <Currency (PART) Explained>`. At the same time, the :term:`SecureMessaging (SMSG)` protocol processes all the non-financial data that come along with running a :term:`decentralized <Decentralization>` marketplace.

Every transaction on the :term:`Particl Marketplace` is private and confidential by default.
