Particl Marketplace Explained
=============================

Here comes a comprehensive technical deepdive. Remove all deeper explations from other pages and move them into this document. Except those from the in-depth series. So, this page becomes an index with technicals and links into other in-depth articles.

I copy and paste things I removed from other pages into here.

Particl is a decentralized marketplace, meaning that no third-party is required to facilitate transactions. Thereâ€™s no marketplace company, e-commerce service provider, payment processor, or even bank involved. Transactions happen directly between you and the other person.

The marketplace is composed mainly of three main distributed networks. 

- The :term:`Particl blockchain` to enable user to user currency transactions without requiring payment processors or banks.

- The :term:`SecureMessaging (SMSG)` to distribute and host non-transactional data such as the marketplace's listings and markets, their descriptions, images, messages, and etc.

- The :term:`Tor` network to keep your digital identity (your IP address) confidential when using Particl.
