While the :term:`Particl Marketplace` is an easy-to-use e-commerce platform aimed at the end-user, what happens in the background is relatively complex and employs several brand new technologies.

Instead, it relies on an intricate combination of distributed technologies developed, maintained, and run by a vast and global network of participants.

* **Autonomous**—runs by itself and requires no human intervention
* **Secure**—the highest level of digital security provided by trustless encryption
* **Private**—no data or personal information collected about you
* **Resilient**—can’t be censored, hacked, or shut down by anyone
* **Censorship-proof**—no predefined rules or policies, and no ban on items
* **Near-zero fee**—only pay the bare minimum for the network to run by itself

These advantages are only possible thanks to the particularly decentralized nature of the :term:`Particl Marketplace`.
