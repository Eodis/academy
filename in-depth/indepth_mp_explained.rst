Decentralized e-commerce
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 

While the :term:`Particl Marketplace` is an easy-to-use e-commerce platform, what happens in the background is relatively complex and employs several brand new technologies. There's no server, central database, or employees working at keeping the marketplace up and running. Instead, it relies on an intricate combination of distributed technologies developed, maintained, and run by a vast and global network of participants.

* **Autonomous**—runs by itself and requires no human intervention
* **Secure**—the highest level of digital security provided by trustless encryption
* **Private**—no data or personal information collected about you
* **Resilient**—can’t be censored, hacked, or shut down by anyone
* **Censorship-proof**—no predefined rules or policies, and no ban on items
* **Near-zero fee**—only pay the bare minimum for the network to run by itself

These advantages are only possible thanks to the particularly decentralized nature of the :term:`Particl Marketplace`.
