Security and Privacy
====================

Digital security and privacy is a fundamental human right. Over the last few years, the various internet service providers you use every day have amassed a downright scary amount of personal information about you. It is even said that **tech giants know more about you than you do yourself**. 

The irresponsible handling of that data is causing constant breaches, leaks, misuses, and abuses of your personal information. This leads to endless identity thefts, financial losses, frauds, unauthorized access to online accounts, and headaches.

Why should using the internet be so risky? Although it was never designed to end up this way, the lack of data security and online privacy has become a persistent side-effect of using the internet. **Particl reverses that trend** in one fell swoop and gives you back **full control over your digital life**.

Your Privacy on Particl
---------------------

To guarantee the security of your personal information and your privacy, Particl adopts a vastly different approach than other internet service providers—**it gives you full ownership over your own data**.

Instead of forcing you to agree to endless and incomprehensible terms and conditions aimed at collecting your personal information, **Particl simply doesn't generate any identifiable data about you at all**. 

If no data exists in the first place, then it can't be collected by anyone. And if it can't be collected, then it can't be leaked or misused. Very simply, **Particl doesn't ask for your trust, it just never knows anything about you ever**.

This groundbreaking level of online privacy is made possible thanks to Particl's distributed nature and the vast array of security protocols implemented on its network. 


No Central Database
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All issues related to online data have something in common—personal information was stored and obtained from some company's database either willingly (data sharing policies) or unwillingly (data breaches). But that is simply impossible on Particl because **it isn't built like your typical online marketplace**. 

It is an entirely autonomous platform that runs on peer-to-peer (P2P) and blockchain technologies. It's not a company, it's not running on servers, it doesn't have any central database, and it doesn't require any middleman such as a payment processor to function.

In other words, **none of your personal information is ever stored on any database**. There is not a single party that can know anything about you and use that information for any reason.


Account Information
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To use online marketplaces, you generally need accounts. That's because marketplaces want to know you as much as possible so they can personalize your experience on their platform, get more money out of you, and then monetize your data. 

But having an account still has its upsides. It allows the marketplace to remember useful information such as your order history, shipping addresses, payment details, market preferences, and more. It can make your life much easier.

This is why **Particl stores your account information locally on your computer** and never shares any of its data with anyone else. Any personal information it contains is encrypted via military-grade encryption so that no one else but you can access it.

Browsing History and Shopping Habits
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Just like your account information, traditional marketplaces track your browsing history and shopping habits to know as much as they can about you. They even openly share it with partners who in turn share their users' information back. 

Marketplaces and other online services typically use that kind of data to figure out what you like, what product they think you would buy, how to optimize their services, and etc. 

It certainly can be useful, but it isn't all fine and dandy. The obsession marketplaces have with your browsing history and shopping habits not only constantly leads to data breaches, but also `intimate and straight up uncomfortable situations <https://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2012/02/16/how-target-figured-out-a-teen-girl-was-pregnant-before-her-father-did/#74d645eb6668>`_. Remember, **online service providers tend to know more about you and the ones you love than you do yourself**.

Particl hands you back your online privacy by making it impossible for anyone in the world to know your browsing history and shopping habits because **no identifiable data is being generated about you at all**.

Transaction Data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Particl isn't built on typical internet and financial technologies. It's instead built on blockchain technology and requires payments to be made with cryptocurrencies. And while it enables cheap and near instant payments on a global scale, it does poorly from an online privacy perspective. 

In fact, public blockchains permanently store all the information of the transactions that happen on their network in a public ledger. It lets anyone in the world easily access and collect the information of any transaction ever.

That's not the case with Particl. Instead of using a public blockchain, it uses one that **lets you to keep your data confidential**. 

When using the marketplace, none of your transaction information is stored in any meaningful way. Sure, it still ends up on the blockchain, but what can be access by anyone else is as good as gibberish. The marketplace generates entirely **anonymous transactions**. 

It's still possible to make public transactions on Particl, but not when using the marketplace. To learn more about the different types of balances and transactions on Particl, head over to the :doc:`PART Cryptocurrency <in-depth/indepth_part_coin>` in-depth guide.

Network Identity
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Another type of data that can be pretty damaging when it get stolen is your network identity (IP address). Your IP address is your own unique internet identity which is shared across all your internet-connected devices. If enough data can be linked to your IP address, your identity is revealed and it becomes possible to track all of your online activity.

Like any type of data, it can make your online experience more convenient. But it can also make your life hell if it ends up in the wrong hands. 

On Particl, it's impossible for anyone to associate an IP address to any other Particl-related data. And while your IP address is broadcast to other peers on the network, it doesn't reveal anything meaninful about you. The only thing it really tells is that someone in the world owns this IP address and uses Particl.

If you want to take your online privacy a step further, you can **route your connection through the Tor network**, a networking protocol used to spoof internet connections. This will broadcast a fake IP address to the network and keep your real one confidential.

Marketplace-Related Privacy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Particl's marketplace takes your security and privacy very seriously. It is built from the ground up in such a way that never creates any useful data about what you. When no data exists, it can't be collected, analyzed, and shared with anyone else. 

Uploaded content
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you upload content like images online, it often contains sensitive data about you like where the picture was taken (geo-location) or what device was used to take the picture. This is a big privacy issue that can lead you to unwillingly reveal the location of your home, for example.

To protect you from this, Particl encrypts and strips every image of its metadata before broadcasting it to the rest of the network. This makes it impossible for anyone to collect any useful information about user uploaded images.

Two-party escrow system
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a transaction goes wrong and needs to be resolved by a third-party, marketplaces act as the deciding factor by issuing a resolution. They have the final say in who should get the money when a conflict arise. They can also ban users, force refunds, and etc.

This puts the security of your data and your online privacy at great risk. While a third-party can protect your from scammers and help you out when you need it, it also gains full access to all of your information.

To offer the same kind of protection without impeding on your online privacy, Particl uses a two-party escrow system. It doesn't involve any third-party. It instead relies on security deposits that can only be refunded once both parties agree a transaction has been completed in a satisfactory way.

This means there is no one that can access any of your personal or transaction information. And as you probably know by now, no identifiable data is created about you in the first place anyway.

Secure messaging
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On traditional marketplaces, all your communications with buyers and sellers are stored, monitored, and analyzed by the marketplace itself. This, of course, exposes a great deal of information about you. It opens the door wide open for anyone, authorized or not, to collect a lot of information about you and use it for their own benefit. 

Particl makes sure to put that issue to rest by encrypting all the messages you send to other people before they even get sent. Only the person you're addressing a message to can open and read it. Messages are not stored on any central database and their content cannot be known by any unauthorized party.
