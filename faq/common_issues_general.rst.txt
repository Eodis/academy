        **Time offset warning icon (top right corner of Particl Desktop)**

    This warning simply means your computer is synced to a different time than the Particl network. Usually, this doesn't cause any noticeable issue, but when the offset gets too big, it can cause errors in the propagation of SMSG messages (listings, escrow, etc).

    - Make sure you haven't made any **typo** in any of the 24 words.
    - Enter your seed's password, if you have any.
    - Try only entering your 24-word passphrase, **without** any password.
    - If all else fails, do a hard reset of Particl.

        **Number of coins not showing up in private balances and transaction history**

    When you hold coins in either blind or anon balances, the balances aren't displayed on your Particl Desktop until you unlock it with your password. This is a security measure designed to keep your private balances private from prying eyes.
