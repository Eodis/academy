        **How can I create a new market identity?**

    The ability to create a new market identity is not enabled by default. To enable the option, go to :guilabel:`Market Settings` > :guilabel:`Advanced Features` and check the :guilabel:`Enable multiple identities for the current profile` box.

    Then, click on the downward facing arrow located above the :guilabel:`Overview` button in the menu on the left. This will display a new option. Simply click on :guilabel:`Click to create...` button to create a new market identity.

        **How can I earn by staking my PART coins?**

    This depends on many factors such as the number of PART coins being staked by other users, the number of transactions on the marketplace, the number of PART transactions on the network, the number of times people promote their market or storefront, and etc.

    To know everything about staking, head over to the :doc:`What's Staking in-depth guide <../in-depth/indepth_staking>`.

        **Why can't I see any listing on the marketplace?**
 
    To see listings on the marketplace, your Particl Desktop client needs to be fully synced with the Particl network. This process can take several minutes, especially if you have a slow internet connection, so don't worry if you're still not seeing anything afte a while. Just leave your Particl Desktop client open and it will eventually catch up.

    Once your client is fully synced, it will be much faster to sync every next time you open it. The initial syncing is the longest process and doesn't need to be repeated every time.

        **How can I get more technical support?**

    First, make sure that your question or issue isn't already addressed somewhere in the Particl Academy. That's the easiest way to fix most problems. Have you tried the search function? If you can't find the answer you're looking for in there, then head over to the :doc:`Get Support <../faq/get_support>` section to get more help!
