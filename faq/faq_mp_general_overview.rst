        **How can I earn by staking my PART coins?**

    This depends on many factors such as the number of PART coins being staked by other users, the number of transactions on the marketplace, the number of PART transactions on the network, the number of times people promote their market or storefront, and etc.

    To know everything about staking, head over to the :doc:`What's Staking in-depth guide <in-depth/indepth_staking>`.

        **Why can't I see any listing on the marketplace?**
 
    To see listings on the marketplace, your Particl Desktop client needs to be fully synced with the Particl network. This process can take several minutes, especially if you have a slow internet connection, so don't worry if you're still not seeing anything afte a while. Just leave your Particl Desktop client open and it will eventually catch up.

    Once your client is fully synced, it will be much, much faster to sync every next time you open it. The initial syncing is the longest process and doesn't need to be repeated every time.

    .. container:: header

        **Why isn't the seller moving after I placed an order?**
 
    If your Particl Desktop client is protected by a password (encrypted), **you need to unlock it with your password** so that it can pick up new orders from the Particl network. If you keep your client locked, then it won't be able to receive updates on your order.

        **Why does the marketplace require me to pay twice the value of the item I want to buy?**
 
    That's because half of that full payment is a security deposit which will be refunded to you, at no fee at all, once the transaction is fully completed. In other words, if you're buying an item worth $100 (including shipping), then you'll be required to pay $200. One half of the payment is the payment for the seller ($100) and the other half is your security deposit ($100) which you'll get back in full after the transaction is completed.

        **Can anyone else other than the seller can see my shipping address?**
 
    No. Only the seller can access your shipping details. Neither Particl nor anyone else in the world other than the seller can collect your personal information. Particl is completely decentralized and private by design.

    .. container:: header

        **How can I directly contact a seller?**

    You can leave a comment in a listing's ``Question and Answers`` section. This will notify the seller that they've received a message and they'll be able to answer you. Keep in mind that the ``Questions and Answers`` section is public, meaning all messages you and the seller leaves there are publicly visible. 

    Alternatively, sellers may leave their contact information such as an email address or instant messaging application username in the descriptions of their listing. Look in there and see if you can find something.

    A more complete messaging system will be added at a later time during the Beta phase of development. To know what next features are planned for the marketplace, refer to `Particl's development roadmap <https://particl.io/roadmap>`_.

        **How can I ask for a refund or return through the marketplace?**

    Due to the current stage of development of the Particl marketplace (Beta), this feature is currently not supported. If you want to ask a seller for a refund or return, please try to reach out to them by their provided contact information or through the ``Questions and Answers`` section of the listing you have an issue with. 

    Direct messaging and escrow management/negociations will be added at a later time during the Beta phase of development. To know what next features are planned for the marketplace, refer to `Particl's development roadmap <https://particl.io/roadmap>`_.

        **Where can I find the tracking number of one of my order?**

    When a seller leaves you a tracking number, you can check it out right from your Particl Desktop client. To do so, head over to the ``Orders`` page of the ``SELL`` section of your client, find the order which you want to find its tracking number, and click on its tile to expand the order's details.

    A seller may not always leave a tracking number, but when they do, that's where you'll find it!

.. container:: toggle

    .. container:: header

        **How can I cancel an order?**

    It's only possible to cancel an order if it hasn't yet been accepted by the seller. Direct messaging and escrow management/negociations will be added at a later time during the Beta phase of development. This will let you communicate with the seller and ask for your order to be cancelled.

        **How long do listings stay on the marketplace?**

    That's all up to you! The expiry time for listings on the marketplace depends on the listing fee you pay. When publishing one or multiple listings, the Particl Desktop client will prompt you to select the number of days you want your listings to stay live. Simply choose the number of days from the dropdown menu and you're all set!

    Go in ``LISTINGS``, click on the tile of your listing, and navigate to the ``Questions and Answers`` tab. There, you'll see all comments left on your listing with the option to reply to them.

        **Why does my product shows up in "Reported listings" and what does this mean?**

    If one of your listing shows up in the *Reported listings* section, it means at least one person has flagged it as inappropriate. If enough people do the same, it will be taken off the marketplace entirely. If your listing shows up in the reported listings section but still shows up on the marketplace, it means that not enough people have flagged it.

        **Why are listing fees different between different items?**

    Listing fees are determined by two factors â€” the expiry time of an item and its listing size. Depending on the number of days you want a product to be listed on the marketplace for as well as the size of its listing description, listing fees will vary. 

    For this reason, even if you list two different items for the same amount of time, their required listing fee may differ if one contains *more data* than the others.
