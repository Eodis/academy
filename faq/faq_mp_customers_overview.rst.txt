        **What does each order status mean?**

    - :guilabel:`BIDDING`: You have made a bid on an item and are now waiting for the vendor to accept it.
    - :guilabel:`ACCEPTED`: The vendor has accepted your order and is now waiting for you to send the payment and your security deposit in escrow.
    - :guilabel:`ESCROW`: You have locked your funds in escrow and are now waiting for the vendor to lock their security deposit as well.
    - :guilabel:`PACKAGING`: The vendor is now packaging your order and and getting it ready to ship.
    - :guilabel:`SHIPPING`: The vendor has shipped your item and is now waiting for you to receive and confirm the delivery.
    - :guilabel:`COMPLETE`: You have received your order and have confirmed the order as "complete". There are no more required actions in this transaction, and you've received your security deposit back.

        **Why isn't the seller updating my order after I placed a bid?**
 
    If your :term:`Particl Desktop` is protected by a password (encrypted), **you need to unlock it with your password** to receive order updates. If you keep your client locked, you won't receive the notifications and won't be able to progress to the next step.

    If your order is still not updated after unlocking your client, that's because the seller hasn't done it yet. Wait for the vendor to update the order, or try leaving them a message in the :guilabel:`Comments and Reviews` section of the listing page!

        **Why does the marketplace require me to pay twice the value of the item I want to buy?**
 
    That's because you need to fund the escrow contract with a security deposit equal to the total value of your order. This deposit will be refunded to you at no fee at all once the transaction is fully completed. 

    For example, if you're buying an item worth $100 (including shipping), then you'll be required to deposit a total of $200 into the escrow smart-contract. Half of this deposit is for the payment of the item to the seller ($100), and the other half is your security deposit ($100) which you'll get back, with no fee, after the transaction is completed.

        **Can anyone else other than the seller see my shipping address?**
 
    No. Only the seller can access your shipping details. Neither Particl nor anyone else can collect your personal information. Particl is entirely decentralized, secure, and private by design.

        **How can I directly contact a seller?**

    You can leave a comment in a listing's :guilabel:`Comments and Reviews` section. This will notify the seller that they've received a message, and they'll be able to answer you. Keep in mind that the :guilabel:`Comments and Reviews` section is public, meaning all messages you and the seller leaves there are publicly visible.

    Alternatively, sellers may sometimes leave their contact information such as an email address or instant messaging application username in their listing descriptions. Look in there and see if you can find something.

    A more complete and private messaging/inbox system is being developed and will be added later during the Beta phase of development. To know what next features are planned for the :term:`Particl Marketplace`, refer to `Particl's development roadmap <https://particl.io/roadmap>`_.

        **How can I ask for a refund or return through the marketplace?**

    Due to the current stage of development of the :term:`Particl Marketplace` (Beta), this feature is currently not supported. If you want to ask a seller for a refund or return, please try to reach out to them by their provided contact information or through the :guilabel:`Comments and Reviews` section of the listing you have an issue with. 

    Direct messaging and a resolution center are planned features for later on during Beta. To know what next features are planned for the :term:`Particl Marketplace`, refer to `Particl's development roadmap <https://particl.io/roadmap>`_.

        **Where can I find the tracking number of one of my orders?**

    When a seller leaves you a tracking number, you can check it out right from your Particl Desktop client. To do so, head over to the :guilabel:`Orders` page of the :guilabel:`SELL` section, find the order that you want to find the tracking number of, and click on it to expand its details.

    A seller may not always leave a tracking number, but when they do, that's where you'll find it!

        **How can I cancel an order?**

    It's only possible to cancel an order if the seller hasn't yet accepted it. Otherwise, you can try reaching out to the seller by their provided contact information or through the :guilabel:`Comments and Reviews` section of the listing.
