        **How long do listings stay on the marketplace?**

    That's all up to you! The expiry time for listings on the marketplace depends on the listing fee you pay. When publishing one or multiple listings, the Particl Desktop client will prompt you to select the number of days you want your listings to stay live. Simply choose the number of days from the dropdown menu and you're all set!

        **How can I publish listings again after they expire?**

    Go to the :guilabel:`Inventory & Products` tab of the :guilabel:`SELL` page and find the template of the listing you want to republish. Click on its tile to display more options and click on the publishing icon (rocket) next to the market(s) or storefront(s) you want to publish your listing in. You can publish the same listing in many different markets.

        **How can I reply to a question left on one of my listings?**

    Go to your marketplace :guilabel:`Overview` page and look for the :guilabel:`New questions` and :guilabel:`New answers` tiles. Clicking on them will bring you the right page and show you all outstanding questions and replies.

        **Why does my product shows up in "Reported listings" and what does this mean?**

    If one of your listing shows up in the *Reported listings* section, it means at least one person has flagged it as inappropriate. If enough people do the same, it will be taken off the marketplace entirely. If your listing shows up in the reported listings section but still shows up on the marketplace, it means that not enough people have flagged it.

        **Why are listing fees different between different items?**

    Listing fees are determined by two factors â€” the expiry time of the listing and its size. Depending on the number of days you want to list a product as well as the size of its listing description, listing fees will vary.

        **What does each order status mean?**

    - **BIDDING:** A buyer has made a bid on an item and is now waiting for you to accept the bid.
    - **PAYMENT:** You have accepted a bid on an item and are now waiting for the buyer to confirm payment and lock his/her funds (payment + security deposit) into escrow.
    - **ESCROW:** The buyer has locked his/her funds into escrow and is now waiting for you to lock your security deposit into escrow.
    - **PACKAGING:** The buyer of the item is now waiting for you to package the order and ship it.
    - **SHIPPING:** You have marked the item as shipped and are now waiting for the buyer to confirm the delivery.
    - **COMPLETE:** The item has been confirmed to be received by the buyer. There are no more open actions in this transaction and you've received both the payment for the order and your security deposit back.

        **Why am I not receiving any new buy order?**
 
    If your Particl Desktop client is protected by a password (encrypted), **you need to unlock it with your password** so that it can pick up new orders from the Particl network. If you keep your client locked, then it won't be able to receive any order.

        **How can I send a tracking number or note to my customer?**

    Once you mark an order as :guilabel:`shipped` (:ref:`Package and Shipping an Order`), your Particl Desktop client will prompt you to enter a tracking number or note to your customer. It's an entirely optional step but it helps your customers keep track of their order(s).

    A more complete messaging system will be added at a later time during the Beta phase of development. To know what next features are planned for the marketplace, refer to `Particl's development roadmap <https://particl.io/roadmap>`_.

        **How can I directly contact a customer?**

    Due to the current stage of development of the Particl marketplace (Beta), directly messaging a customer is not yet supported. You can, however, send a tracking number or note to your customer as part of the marketplace's transaction flow.

    Once you mark an order as :guilabel:`shipped` (:ref:`Package and Shipping an Order`), your Particl Desktop client will prompt you to enter a tracking number or note to your customer. It's an entirely optional step but it helps your customers keep track of their order(s).

        **How can I cancel an order?**

    Due to the current stage of development of the Particl marketplace (Beta), it's currently not possible to cancel an order once you have fully locked your security deposit in escrow. Direct messaging and escrow management/negociations will be added at a later time during the Beta phase of development. This will let you communicate with your buyer and  cancel, update, and resolve orders.
