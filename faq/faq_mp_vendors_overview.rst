        **Why am I not receiving any new order?**
 
    If you have encrypted your Particl Desktop client, **you need to unlock it with your password** so that it can pick up new orders from the Particl network. If you keep your client locked, then it won't be able to receive any order. 

    This functionality will be added at a later stage during the Beta phase of development. To know what next features are planned for the marketplace, refer to `Particl's development roadmap <https://particl.io/roadmap>`_.

        **How long do listings stay on the marketplace?**

    That's all up to you! The expiry time for listings on the marketplace depends on the listing fee you pay. When publishing one or multiple listings, the Particl Desktop client will prompt you to select the number of days you want your listings to stay live. Simply choose the number of days from the dropdown menu and you're all set!

    - **BIDDING:** A buyer has made a bid on an item and is now waiting for you to accept the bid.

        **How can I send a tracking number or note to my customer?**

    Once you mark an order as ``SHIPPED``, your Particl Desktop client will prompt you to enter a tracking number or note to your customer. It's an entirely optional step but it helps your customers keep track of their order(s).

    A more complete messaging system will be added at a later time during the Beta phase of development. To know what next features are planned for the marketplace, refer to `Particl's development roadmap <https://particl.io/roadmap>`_.

        **Why does my product shows up in "Reported listings" and what does this mean?**

    If one of your listing shows up in the *Reported listings* section, it means at least one person has flagged it as inappropriate. If enough people do the same, it will be taken off the marketplace entirely. If your listing shows up in the reported listings section but still shows up on the marketplace, it means that not enough people have flagged it.
