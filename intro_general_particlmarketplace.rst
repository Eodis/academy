Particl is a two-sided marketplace like Amazon, eBay, and Alibaba, but with no commission on sales, near-zero fees, no login data requirement, and with a heavy focus on user security and privacy. Its person-to-person (P2P) nature lets you connect directly with buyers and sellers from all around the world without requiring any third-party to facilitate transactions. Additionally, no identifiable data is generated when using the marketplace, meaning your date, shopping habits, and personal information remain safe at all time and can't be collected, shared, sold, misused, hacked, or leaked by any party.

Benefits of using Particl
-------------------------

Its unique combination of blockchain and peer-to-peer technologies provides you with a lot of benefits long thought to be impossible on traditional marketplaces. 

No Sales Commission
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Similarly to torrents, Particl runs on a distributed network of nodes hosted by volunteers scattered across the world. It is a completely autonomous platform that doesn't require any central party to operate, which also means that there is no company or organization charging you fees and taking a commission out of every sales.  

It's true! On Particl, there is no commission/sales fee, no subscription fee, and no escrow fee, no nonsense. The only fees the platform charges, which are only in place to deter spam, is a small listing fee when putting items up for sale and a cryptocurrency transaction fee. But don't worry, these fees are most often than not smaller than a penny and are entirely redistributed to the volunteers running the nodes. 

As a seller, it lets you keep the totality of your sales revenue in your pockets and makes you more money per sale. This, in turn, opens up the possibility to reduce your prices to beat your competition and make even more sales!

As a buyer, you definitely get to benefit from this as well by finding more affordable products than on traditional marketplaces. When sellers don't need to cut marketplace operators a portion of their revenue anymore, everyone wins!

Unstoppable, Uncensorable
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Since the marketplace runs autonomously on a distributed and global network of nodes, it cannot be shut down and can't be controlled by any central party. That's not the case with traditional marketplaces who needs to rely on multiple parties such as the marketplace operator itself, the payment processors it uses, the web/servers hoster, domain registrar, and etc.

Concretely, this means two things. First, Particl has a 100% uptime and cannot be taken offline due to spam or outside influence. Secondly, it also means that no product or user can be banned from the marketplace or censored by an administrator or central authority. Instead, the marketplace's rules are determined by its community users who all have the ability to flag and take out undesirable content.

Simply put, Particl is a very resilient platform operating on the basic principles of free market and direct democracy. It gives you and every other people a voice. 

Unmatched Security and Privacy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you start using Particl, data breaches are a thing of the past. Thanks to its unique combination of blockchain and peer-to-peer technologies, the Particl network provides you with the highest level of digital security possible to this day. The marketplace ensures your personal and business information remains private at all time by not generating any meaningful data in the first place. If it doesn't exist, it can't be collected, shared, sold, misused, hacked, or leaked by any party.
