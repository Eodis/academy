Sell Process
============

The selling process of Particl Marketplace gives you more privacy, security, and censorship resistance than any other online marketplace and is entirely free to use except for the tiny sub-cent transaction fees usually associated with cryptocurrency transactions. **The price to pay for these previously impossible benefits is that you are required to do things a bit differently than what you are used to.**

Rest assured, it's not complicated at all. Just follow this quick user guide and you'll be up to speed in no time!

The entire process of selling a product, from A to Z, can be seen in this walkthrough tutorial video.

Publish Items
------------------

.. attention::

   To put an item for sale on Particl, you need to have PART coins in your :guilabel:`Public` or :guilabel:`Anon` balance so that you can pay for the listing fees. Funds in your :guilabel:`Anon` balance are also required to make security deposits into escrow contracts (which is equal to the value of any item purchased by a buyer).

To make a sale on Particl, you need to first put items up for sale. There are many ways to create listings on Particl. The right way **for you** depends on your requirements.

Publish a Single Item
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you only want to list a single item, then simply follow these steps.

  #. Wait until the network goes through one (1) blockchain confirmation (approximately 2 minutes), and then your listing will be live on the Particl Marketplace.

If you want to publish later
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Instead of publishing your listing immediately, you can save its template for later. When creating your listing template, instead of clicking on :guilabel:`Save and Publish`, you can click on the :guilabel:`Save` button to save your listing template and publish it later instead of right now.

.. rst-class:: bignums

  #. To publish a listing after it's been saved, navigate to the :guilabel:`Inventory & Products` tab of the :guilabel:`SELL` page.
  #. Locate your saved listing and click on its tile to expand the details. Its status will show as :guilabel:`Listing unpublished`.
  #. You can still edit the listing by clicking on the  :guilabel:`Edit` button, or publish it by clicking the :guilabel:`Publish` icon (rocket).
  #. You can also publish your listing in other user markets or storefronts by clicking on the green :guilabel:`Clone Product to Market` button and selecting which market (and category) you want to add your listing template to. 
  #. Choose the amount of time you want your listing to show up on the new market and click on :guilabel:`Publish Listing`.

  #. From this moment, a new market will be connected to your listing template. Repeat these steps for all user markets you want to publish your listing on.

Publish Multiple Items at Once
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are selling multiple items, then you may want to create a CSV inventory file and list all of your products at once. This will save you the time of listing each item one-by-one. 

Publishing multiple listings at once is separated into two steps: (1) creating listing templates and (2) publishing them.

Create listing templates
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The first step of the process is to import your inventory into Particl Desktop using a CSV file and create a listing template for each item.

.. rst-class:: bignums

  #. Navigate to the :guilabel:`SELL` page of the market menu on the left of your Particl Desktop client.
  #. Click on the :guilabel:`Inventory & Products` tab, and then on the :guilabel:`Import` button.
  #. Import your CSV file by clicking on the :guilabel:`Choose file` button of the :guilabel:`IMPORT FROM CSV FILE` section and click on the :guilabel:`Process CSV import` button to process your inventory.
  #. Your Particl Desktop will create one listing template per item. Review each template and, if needed, click on their tiles to expand and edit their details.
  #. When you're ready, click on the :guilabel:`Import & Save` button to create your listing templates

No CSV inventory file yet?

  #. Open it with a spreadsheet editor (i.e. Excel, LibreOffice, etc).
  #. Add as many products as you want following the template's model.


Publish your listing templates
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The second step of the process is to publish the listing templates you've just created on the Open Market or on a user market.

.. rst-class:: bignums

  #. Navigate to the :guilabel:`SELL` page of the market menu on the left of your Particl Desktop client.
  #. Click on the :guilabel:`Inventory & Products` tab, and then on the :guilabel:`Batch (Re)publish...` button.
  #. Select on which market or storefront you want to publish your listings by selecting it from the :guilabel:`PUBLISH TO` dropdown menu.

  #. When ready to publish your listings, click on :guilabel:`Publish selected products` and wait for Particl Desktop to publish your listings. A progress bar at the bottom of the screen indicates the progress.

.. Import WooCommerce Inventory
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  If you are already selling online, more specifically on WooCommerce, then you can simply export your products into a Particl compatible CSV inventory file by following `this WooCommerce tutorial <https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/product-csv-importer-exporter/>`_. Once that is done, you can then easily import the CSV inventory file on Particl by following the simple steps that follow.

    Until automatic fiat rates are supported on Particl, it is required to convert the quoted prices of your WooCommerce products into PART prices. If you want to sell your products for USD and the USD/PART price is $5, then simply type ``5``. Keep in mind these prices do not adjust automatically, which means you'll have to edit that line every time you re-publish your products.
