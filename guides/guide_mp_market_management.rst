Managing Markets and Storefronts
================================

.. note::

   To simplify explanations, "markets" and "storefronts" are simpyl referred to as "markets" unless specified otherwise.

On Particl, you can create and join an infinite number of markets and storefronts. Each of these markets can host an infinite number of listings and live independently from the Open Market. 

When first created, a market isn't accessible to anyone except for the creator and the people he shares the unique access code to. However, the creator can list his market on Particl's ``Market Browser`` so that anyone else can find and join it.
