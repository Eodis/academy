Bidding
=======

To purchase an item on Particl Marketplace, you need to first send a bid to the seller. This is the equivalent of "placing your order". Keep in mind that you will still need to do one more step before you can simply wait for your orders, so keep reading this user guide until the end!

Add an item to your cart
------------------------

.. rst-class:: bignums

	#. Navigate to the :guilabel:`Market` module of Particl Desktop by clicking on it from the outer menu at the very left of the client.
	#. Navigate to the :guilabel:`Listings` page.
	#. Browse the Open Market to find the item you want to purchase or select a different user market from the :guilabel:`Filter` section.
	#. Click on the listing you want to purchase to expand its details.
	#. Make sure the item is shipping in your country and click on the :guilabel:`Shipping & Escrow` tab within the listing's page to make sure you have enough PART funds in your :guilabel:`Anon` balance to make the purchase. You will see the number of PART required for the order under the :guilabel:`Total needed for order` column.
	#. Click on :guilabel:`Add to cart` to add the item to your cart.

	#. Review your order details and click on the :guilabel:`Place order` to send the bid to the seller.
	#. Read the content of the pop up window that appears and click on :guilabel:`Yes, place order` button.

Make Security Deposit
======================

.. note::

   Want to learn more about Particl's two-party escrow system and how it keeps you and your funds safe? Then just visit the :doc:`Two-party Escrow in-depth page <../in-depth/indepth_escrow>` to know all about it!

After placing your order, the seller will have to accept it. Once that happens, you will then need to initiate a two-party escrow contract by making sending to it your order payment as well as your security deposit. The security deposit of any order is always equal to the full value of the order (cost of the item + shipping).

.. rst-class:: bignums

	#. Once you get notified that the seller has accepted your order, navigate to the :guilabel:`Purchases` page of the market section on the left of your Particl Desktop client.
	#. Click on the :guilabel:`Buy Orders` tab.
	#. In the :guilabel:`Filter` section, you can check :guilabel:`Orders requiring attention` to only see orders that requires your attention or filter them by status.
	#. Look for any order marked as :guilabel:`Awaiting Payment`.
	#. Click on the order's tile to expand its details and click on the :guilabel:`Mark as payment` button to lock your funds into the two-party escrow contract.

Order Status Verification
=========================

After funding the escrow contract, the seller will also send his security deposit into the contract and process your order.

At any point in time, you can verify the status of your order. Additionally, once the seller marks your item as shipped, he will have the option to send you a tracking number that you can use to track your package.

.. rst-class:: bignums

	#. Navigate to the :guilabel:`Purchases` page of the market menu on the left of your Particl Desktop client.
	#. Click on the :guilabel:`Your Orders` tab.
	#. Find the order you want to monitor and check its status directly on its tile.
	#. To see if a tracking number has been supplied by the seller, click on the order's tile to expand its details.

Receive Security Deposit
========================

.. attention::
	
	It is very important to come back to Particl Desktop once you receive your order and mark it as complete. Without it, you won't recover your security deposit.

All that is left for you to do is to wait for your package to arrive and mark the transaction as complete. Only once you mark the transaction as complete will you receive your security deposit back, at no fee.

.. rst-class:: bignums

	#. Wait for your package to arrive.
	#. Navigate to the :guilabel:`Purchases` page of the market menu on the left of your Particl Desktop client.
	#. Click on the :guilabel:`Your Orders` tab.
	#. In the :guilabel:`Filter by status` section, you can check :guilabel:`Shipping` to only see orders that have been shipped by sellers but haven't arrived your way yet.
	#. Click on the order's tile to expand its details and click on the :guilabel:`Mark as received` button to complete the transaction and receive your security deposit back.
	#. Unlock your wallet when prompted to.
