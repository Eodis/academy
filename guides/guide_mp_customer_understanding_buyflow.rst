Buying Process
====================

The buying process of Particl's marketplace differs from traditional markets due to its decentralized nature. It grants you more privacy, security, censorship resistance, and is entirely free to use except for the tiny sub-cents transaction fees usually associated with cryptocurrency transactions. The price to pay to get these benefits is that you are required to do things a bit differently than what you are used to.

Rest assured, it's not complicated at all. Just follow this quick user guide and you'll be up to speed in no time!

The entire process of buying a product, from A to Z, can be seen in this walkthrough tutorial video.

Managing Your Balances
----------------------

.. note::

   There is much more to learn about Particl balances, their functions, as well as their levels of privacy. Head to the :doc:Particl balances page <guides/guide_general_particl_balances> right away to know all about it!

There are three different types of coin balances on Particl. Each of them serves a different function within the platform and carries their own level of transactional privacy.

To buy products and services on Particl, you'll only need to have coins in your ``Public`` balance ``Anon`` balance. It is, however, quite useful to also have some coins in your ``Public`` balance as that will allow you to take part in the moderation process of the marketplace by flagging undesirable items and also earn a bit of passive income through Particl's staking process.

Making the Security Deposit
----------------------

.. note::

   Want to learn more about Particl's two-party deposit contract system and how it effectively keeps both parties safe without requiring any intermediary? Then just visit the :doc:Particl two-party escrow contract page <guides/guide_general_particl_balances>. to know all about it!

After placing your order, the seller will have to accept it. Following this, you will need to initiate a two-party escrow contract by locking the full payment of the item (cost of the item + shipping) as well as a security deposit equal to the amount of the full payment. 

The two-party escrow contract ensures that neither you or the seller can misbehave or act dishonestly. This is done by requiring both parties to "put skin in the game" by way of **security deposits that can only be refunded once both parties authorize the release of the funds**. The escrow contract is entirely autonomous, private by design, and doesn't require any intermediary such as an arbitrer or a support staff.

#. Once you get notified that the seller has accepted your order, navigate to the ``PURCHASES`` page of the market menu on the left of your Particl Desktop client.
#. Click on the ``Orders`` tab.
#. In the ``FILTER`` section, you can check  ``Orders requiring attention`` to only see orders that requires your attention or filter them by status.
#. Look for any order marked as ``AWAITING PAYMENT``.
#. Click on the order's tile to expand its details and click on the ``Mark as payment`` button to lock your funds into the two-party escrow contract.

Verifying the Status of Your Order
-------------------------------

After initiating the two-party escrow contract, the seller will send his security deposit into the contract and process your order.

At any point in time, you can verify the status of your order. Additionally, once the seller marks your item as shipped, he will have the option to send you a tracking number that you can use to track your package.

#. Navigate to the ``PURCHASES`` page of the market menu on the left of your Particl Desktop client.
#. Click on the ``Orders`` tab.
#. Find the order you want to monitor and check its status directly on its tile.
#. To see if a tracking number has been supplied by the seller, click on the order's tile to expand its details.

Marking the Order as Received
----------------------

All that is left for you to do is to wait for your package to arrive and mark the transaction as complete. Only once you mark the transaction as complete will you receive your security deposit back, at no fee.

#. Wait for your package to arrive.
#. Navigate to the ``PURCHASES`` page of the market menu on the left of your Particl Desktop client.
#. Click on the ``Orders`` tab.
#. In the ``FILTER BY STATUS`` section, you can check  ``Shipping`` to only see orders that havbe been shipped by sellers but haven't arrived your way yet.
