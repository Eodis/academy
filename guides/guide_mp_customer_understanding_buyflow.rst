   :description lang=en: Learn how the buyflow works on Particl Marketplace from a customer perspective.

The buying process of :term:`Particl Marketplace` gives you more privacy, security, and censorship resistance than any other online marketplace and is entirely free to use except for the tiny sub-cent transaction fees usually associated with :term:`cryptocurrency <Cryptocurrency>` transactions. The price to pay for these previously impossible benefits is that you are required to do things a bit differently than what you are used to.

Rest assured, it's not complicated at all. Just follow this quick user guide and you'll be up to speed in no time!

Bidding
=======

To purchase an item on :term:`Particl Marketplace`, you need to first send a bid to the seller. This is the equivalent of "placing your order". Keep in mind that you will still need to do one more step before you can simply wait for your orders, so keep reading this user guide until the end!

**Add an item to your cart**


.. rst-class:: bignums

	#. Open :guilabel:`Market` -> :guilabel:`BROWSE` to find the item you want to purchase and click on it to expand its details.
	#. Click on the :guilabel:`Shipping & Escrow` tab within the listing's details to make sure the item is shipping in your country and you have enough PART :guilabel:`Anon` balance funds. You will find the number of PART required for the order within the :guilabel:`Total needed for order` column.
	#. Click on :guilabel:`Add to cart`. 

**Send the bid to the seller**


.. rst-class:: bignums

	#. Open :guilabel:`Market` -> :guilabel:`CART` to review the content of your cart and enter your shipping information. 
	#. Click the :guilabel:`Review & Submit this Order` button to review your order's details and click the :guilabel:`Confirm Order & Submit` to send the bid to the seller.
	#. Your bid is now placed and the seller will receive it within minutes. The seller has to confirm your bid and by doing so it becomes an order.

.. hint::
  1. Save your shipping information into a user profile. That way you do not need to rewrite it with every order. To do so, check the :guilabel:`Save shipping profile` box before moving to the next step and give the profile a name.

  3. Since a security deposit is demanded from both parties this step is necessary at the moment.

Make Security Deposit
======================

Once the seller has confirmed your bid it converts into an order when the seller puts his security deposit as well. Your order status will change from :guilabel:`Bidding` to :guilabel:`Escrow`. The security deposit of any order is always equal to the full value of the order (cost of the item + shipping) for both parties.

.. rst-class:: bignums

	#. Await the notification that the seller has accepted your order. 
	#. Open :guilabel:`Market` -> :guilabel:`PURCHASES` -> :guilabel:`Orders` and look for any order marked as :guilabel:`Awaiting Payment`.
	#. Click on the order's tile to expand its details and click on the :guilabel:`Mark as payment` button to lock your funds into the two-party escrow contract.

.. hint::
	2. In the :guilabel:`Filter` section, you can check :guilabel:`Orders requiring attention` to only see orders that require your attention or filter them by status.

Order Status Verification
=========================

At any point in time, you can verify the status of your order. Additionally, once the seller marks your item as shipped, he will have the option to send you a package tracking number.

.. rst-class:: bignums

	#. Open :guilabel:`Market` -> :guilabel:`PURCHASES` -> :guilabel:`Orders` and find the order you want to monitor and check its status directly on its tile. Additional information like a tracking number can be obtained by clicking on the oder's tile which gives you access to other details as well.

Receive Security Deposit Back
=============================

Wait for your package to arrive and mark the transaction as complete. Only once you mark the transaction as complete will you receive your security deposit back. Of course, at no fee.

.. rst-class:: bignums

	#. Wait for your package to arrive.
	#. Open :guilabel:`Market` -> :guilabel:`PURCHASES` -> :guilabel:`Orders`.
	#. Click on the order's tile to expand its details and click on the :guilabel:`Mark as received` button to complete the transaction and receive your security deposit back instantly.

.. attention::
	
	It is very important to come back to :term:`Particl Desktop` once you receive your order and mark it as complete. Without it, you won't recover your security deposit.

.. hint::
	2. In the :guilabel:`Filter by status` section, you can check :guilabel:`Shipping` to only see orders that have been shipped by sellers but haven't arrived your way yet.
