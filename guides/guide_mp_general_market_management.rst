Markets & Storefronts
=====================

.. note::

   To simplify, "community markets" and "storefronts" are simply referred to as "user markets" unless specified otherwise.

On Particl, you can create and join an infinite number of community markets and storefronts. Each of these markets can host an infinite number of listings and live independently from the Open Market.

By default, a user market isn't publicly accessible and is only known to its creator. However, it is possible for a user market to be promoted within the Market Browser so that anyone can join at the click of a button.

Create a User Market
--------------------

Create a community market
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can create and become the full owner of your own community market. A community market is a user market that allows anyone with access to it to buy or sell products and services.

.. rst-class:: bignums

  #. Click :guilabel:`MANAGE MARKETS` and go to the :guilabel:`Your Markets` tab.
  #. Click on the :guilabel:`Create new Market` button to open the market creation page.
  #. Enter a title, a short description, a picture for your market, and then choose the region your market targets (can be worldwide). 
  #. Select the :guilabel:`Community Market` option.
  #. Review the details of your market and click on :guilabel:`Confirm & Create Market`.

Your community market is now created. You can promote it to the Market Browser so that anyone can easily access it or keep its Market ID and Access Key private. Doing that will let you share the access information to only the people you want to. 

Create a Storefront
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can create and become the full owner of your own storefront. A storefront is a user market that allows anyone with access to it to buy products and services, but only those with the Publish Key to list and sell items. It can be generally compared to a seller shop.

.. rst-class:: bignums

  #. Click :guilabel:`MANAGE MARKETS` and go to the :guilabel:`Your Markets` tab.
  #. Click on the :guilabel:`Create new Market` button to open the market creation page.
  #. Enter a title, a short description, a picture for your market, and the choose the region your storefront targets (can be worldwide). 
  #. Select the :guilabel:`Storefront` option.
  #. Review the details of your market and click on :guilabel:`Confirm & Create Market`. 

Your storefront is now created. You can promote it to the Market Browser so that anyone can easily access it or keep its Market ID and Access Key private. Doing that will let you share the access information to only the people you want to. 

Additionally, you can keep the Publish Key to yourself if you want to be the only storefront's seller or share it with trusted people to invite them as sellers.

.. attention::

   Anyone with access to the Publish Key can share it with anyone else. Only share the Publish Key to people you trust and know won't leak it out.

Publish Listings
----------------

To publish listings to your new community market or storefront, Simply go through the normal :doc:`product listing process <../guides/guide_mp_vendor_understanding_sellflow>` and choose your user market when ready to publish your item(s). 

Promote a Market
------------------

If you want anyone to have access to your community market or storefront, you can promote it to the Market Browser. This will make your market publicly accessible and let anyone in the world join it and purchase items. 

Do not promote your market if you want to keep it privately accessible to only a few people.

.. rst-class:: bignums

  #. Go to the :guilabel:`MANAGE MARKETS` page and navigate to the :guilabel:`Your Markets` tab.
  #. Click on the tile of the market you want to promote to display its options.
  #. Click on the :guilabel:`Promote in Market Browser` icon at the bottom of the expanded tile to open the market promotion window.
  #. Select the number of days you want to promote your market for and click on :guilabel:`Promote Market` to promote it.

Browse the Market Browser
---------------------------

You can explore and join all the community markets and storefronts that have been promoted by their creators or users. The Market Browser not only provides you with a list of all publicly accessibly user markets, but also with all the required information for your client to automatically join them (MarketID and Access Key).

.. rst-class:: bignums

  #. Go to the :guilabel:`MANAGE MARKETS` page and navigate to the :guilabel:`Browser` tab.
  #. Browse the publicly accessible user markets and storefronts and find one you want to join.
  #. Click on its tile to expand its options and click on :guilabel:`Join this Market` to connect to it.
  #. Go back to the :guilabel:`Your Markets` tab to see that you have successfully connected to the user market.
  #. Click on its tile to expand its options and click on :guilabel:`Browse Market` to explore its content.
  #. Alternatively, you can access its content by going to the :guilabel:`LISTINGS` page and selecting the user market in the :guilabel:`FILTER` section.

Join a Market
----------------

If you have in your possession the Market ID and Access/Publish Key of a certain user market, you can directly join it even if it's not promoted on the Market Browser. If you only have the Access Key of a storefront, you will only be able to buy items. If you instead possess its Publish Key, then you'll be able to join as a full vendor and also publish and sell items. 

.. rst-class:: bignums

  #. First, make sure that you possess the Market ID and Market Access Key of the market/storefront you want to join. You may need to collect this information from private sources if they are not publicly broadcast by its creator or users.
  #. Go to the :guilabel:`MANAGE MARKETS` page, navigate to the :guilabel:`Browser` tab, and click on the :guilabel:`Join via Market ID` button to expand the window to join a new market.
  #. Fill the user market's information. This information can be entirely decided by you to help you better organize your markets and know what they're about.
  #. Enter the user market's Market ID and Access/Publish Key, and then click on the :guilabel:`Join this Market` button to join the user market.
  #. Go back to the :guilabel:`Your Markets` tab to see that you have successfully connected to the user market.
  #. Click on its tile to expand its options and click on :guilabel:`Browse Market` button to explore its content.
  
      - Alternatively, you can access its content by going to the :guilabel:`LISTINGS` page and selecting the user market in the :guilabel:`FILTER` section.
