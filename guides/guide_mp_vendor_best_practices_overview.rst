Vendor Best Practices
=====================

:term:`Particl Marketplace` is a :ref:`trustless marketplace <trustless setup>`, meaning that no single party controls it. Instead, the marketplace runs autonomously on a decentralized network which shifts the balance of responsibilities on the users rather than on the company operating the platform.

For this reason, it is well advised for you to follow a range of best practices so that you can fully enjoy all the benefits that :term:`Particl Marketplace` and the free market has to offer.

General
-------

Understanding Particl Marketplace 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Make sure you know how :term:`Particl Marketplace` and its various features work. The best way to do just that is to read the documentation contained here on the Particl Academy.
- Because you can't receive any new order or updates on active orders when your :term:`Particl Desktop` client is locked, make sure to unlock it before you start processing and working on orders.

Customer Care
-------------

Dispute management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Because there is no internal messaging feature on :term:`Particl Marketplace` yet, it is recommended to provide your customers with an external mean of communications (i.e., email address, telegram handle, etc) to resolve any potential issue.
- Remain neutral, comprehensive, and show your customer you are willing to work through the issue. You need your customer to be satisfied with the proposed resolution(s) for funds locked in :doc:`escrow <../in-depth/indepth_escrow>` to be released.

Dispute prevention
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Respond in a timely manner to Comments and Reviews
- Be as clear as possible in your product description. Avoid hyperboles and misrepresentations.
- Provide accurate and realistic shipping time estimates.
- Put in place a solid and unambiguous after-sale policy with clear return and refund policies.
- Because there is no internal messaging feature on :term:`Particl Marketplace` yet, it is recommended to provide your customers with an external mean of communications (i.e., email address, telegram handle, etc) to discuss any issue or matter that could lead to a conflict.
- Recommend to your customers that they leave a phone number so that a shipping service provider can contact them if required.

Article not received/broken 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Always verify the tracking number when a customer claims they have not received a product.
- Call the shipping service provider to determine whether there has been an error in the shipping of the package or its processing.
- Put your phone number and return address on the package when shipping. If there's an issue with the package, it can then safely be returned to you or the shipping service provider will call you to resolve the matter.


Tracking numbers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- When marking an order has "shipping", you have an option to send to your customer a note. This is where you can put the tracking number of the delivery. You can also type in any other information relevant to the order.
- It is recommended to keep a copy of the tracking number at least until the buyer confirms that they have received the delivery. That will help you in case a dispute arises.
- Because the customer expects a secure and private e-commerce experience from :term:`Particl Marketplace`, please keep any information or data you save about your customers or orders secured and private.
