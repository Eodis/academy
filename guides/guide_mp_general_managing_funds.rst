Receive Coins 
-------------

There are multiple ways you can fund your balance with PART coins.

**From another PART address**

Receive PART coins coming from any wallet holding PART funds. This can be a personal wallet, a public exchange service provider, or a hardware wallet. 

.. rst-class:: bignums

	#. Open :guilabel:`Wallet` -> :guilabel:`Receive`.
	#. Receive :guilabel:`Public` or :guilabel:`Private` funds by choosing from the tabs menu on the top of the page. 
	#. Share your address with another party to recieve funds.  
	
.. tip::

	#. Both the sender and receiver must agree on the type of funds (exchanges, for example, only support :guilabel:`Public` transactions).
	#. Create a new :guilabel:`Receive` address. (Optional but recommended)
	#. Adding a label to an address is really helpful to not get confused. 
	#. When posting the address from the clipboard to another party, always verify and double-check the pasted address with the original. Make sure it is identical. Remember: **You are your own bank**.

**From the in-app swap-exchange module**

The in-app swap-exchange module allows you to obtain PART funds without the need to visit an external exchange.

Convert Balances
----------------

Converting balances is needed if you want to switch and/or convert between the different PART privacy states. Also referred as :ref:`Types of balances`.

.. rst-class:: bignums

	#. Open :guilabel:`Wallet` -> :guilabel:`Send / Convert` ->  :guilabel:`Convert Public & Private`.
	#. In the :guilabel:`Pay From` section, select the source of funds you would like to convert. In the :guilabel:`Convert To` section, select the destination of funds you would like to recieve.
	#. Type in the number of coins you want to send to your other balance and click on the :guilabel:`Make Payment` button.
	#. Review the transaction details and click on the :guilabel:`Confirm & Send` button to start the process.
		
.. tip:: 

    #. Wait for twelve (12) confirmations (approximately 24 minutes) before the funds in the anon balance can be used without restriction.
    #. You can track the status of transactions in the :guilabel:`Overview` module under :guilabel:`Recent Transactions`
