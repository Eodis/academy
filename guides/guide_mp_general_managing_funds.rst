Needed Funds
============



PART funds needed for selling
-----------------------------

To sell products and services on :term:`Particl Marketplace`, you'll need to have coins in both your :guilabel:`Public` balance and in your :guilabel:`Anon` balance.

PART funds needed for buying
----------------------------

To buy products and services on :term:`Particl Marketplace`, you'll only need to have coins in your :guilabel:`Anon` balance. It is, however, quite useful to also have some coins in your :guilabel:`Public` balance as that will allow you to take part in the moderation process of the marketplace by flagging undesirable items. It'll also let you earn a bit of passive and dividend-like income through Particl's staking process.

Receive Coins 
==============

There are multiple ways you can fund your balance with PART coins.

From another PART address
-------------------------

You can receive PART coins coming from any wallet holding PART funds. This can be a personal wallet, a public exchange service provider, or a hardware wallet. 

.. rst-class:: bignums

	#. Click on the :guilabel:`Wallet` in the dapps menu at the very left and click on :guilabel:`Receive` in the main menu.
	#. Receive :guilabel:`Public` or :guilabel:`Private` funds by choosing from the tabs menu on the top of the page. 
	#. Share this address with another party to recieve funds.  
	
.. tip::

	#. Both the sender and receiver must agree on the type of funds (exchanges, for example, only support public transactions).
	#. Optionally, you can create a new receive address. It enhances your privacy.
	#. Adding a label to an address in really helpful to not get confused. 
	#. When posting the address from the clipboard to another party, always very and double-check the pasted address with the original. Make sure it is identical. Remember: *You are your own bank*.

From the in-app exchange module
-------------------------------

The in-app exchange module allows you to obtain PART funds without the need to visit an external exchange. At a later stage this will be used as onramp and offramp for many different currencies including national currencies like the US Dollar or the Euro.

.. rst-class:: bignums

	#. Click on the :guilabel:`Swap` module in the dapps menu at the very left and click on :guilabel:`Start New Exchange` afterwards in the main content area. 
	#. Set the number of PART coins you want to obtain and select the currency you want to swap-in for PART coins. Then click on the :guilabel:`Next` button.
	#. Review the quote offered by the exchange. Click on the :guilabel:`Next` button to confirm.
	#. Send your coins to the address provided and wait for the transaction to be completed. This can take several minutes depending on the exchange and the currency you trade for.

.. note::

	**Prerequisite:** Enable the desired exchange bot.

	#. Navigate to the :guilabel:`Bot Management` module.
	#. Choose an exchange and enable its bot by expanding its tile and then clicking on the :guilabel:`Enable bot` button.

.. attention:: 
   
   Particl's in-app swap engine is temporarily unavaible. We are working to get it back up as soon as possible!

Convert Balances
================

Converting balances is needed if you want to switch and/or convert between the different PART privacy states mentioned in :doc:`PART Cryptocurrency in-depth guide <../in-depth/indepth_part_coin>`.

.. rst-class:: bignums

	#. Click on the :guilabel:`Wallet` in the dapps menu at the very left and click on the :guilabel:`Send / Convert` in the main menu. Click on the :guilabel:`Convert Public & Private` tab in the content area.

	#. Type in the number of coins you want to send to your other balance and click on the :guilabel:`Make Payment` button.
	#. Review the transaction details and click on the :guilabel:`Confirm & Send` button to start the process.
		
.. tip:: 

    #. Wait for twelve (12) confirmations (approximately 24 minutes) before the funds in the anon balance can be used without restriction.
