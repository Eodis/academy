	There are three different types of coin balances on Particl. Each of them serves a different function within the platform and carries their own level of transactional privacy.

	Learn about those different types with the :doc:`PART Cryptocurrency in-depth guide <../in-depth/indepth_part_coin>`

Needed Funds
============



PART funds needed for selling
-----------------------------

To sell products and services on Particl Marketplace, you'll need to have coins in both your :guilabel:`Public` balance and in your :guilabel:`Anon` balance.

PART funds needed for buying
----------------------------

To buy products and services on Particl Marketplace, you'll only need to have coins in your :guilabel:`Anon` balance. It is, however, quite useful to also have some coins in your :guilabel:`Public` balance as that will allow you to take part in the moderation process of the marketplace by flagging undesirable items and also earn a bit of passive income through Particl's staking process.

Receive Coins 
==============

There are multiple ways you can fund your balance with PART coins.

From another PART address
-------------------------

Another PART address is any wallet holding PART funds. This can be a personal wallet, a public exchange service provider or a hardware wallet. 

.. rst-class:: bignums

	#. Navigate to the :guilabel:`Receive` module in the :guilabel:`Wallet` section of the menu on the 	left of your Particl Desktop client.
	#. Choose if you want to receive :guilabel:`Public` or :guilabel:`Private` funds from the tab-menu. 	Sender and reciever must agree on that. E.g. exchanges do only support public transactions.
		- Optionally create a :guilabel:`New address` below the :guilabel:`QR code` image.
		- Optionally type a label into the :guilabel:`Label` field to give an address a purpose. 
	#. Click on the :guilabel:`Copy address` button to copy your address into your clipboard. 
	#. Send this address to another party so that they can send you PART coins or send some yourself from 	another Particl wallet.
	
.. tip::

	When posting the address from the clipboard to another party do **always** compare the pasted address with the origin. That way you ensure your and your other parties safety. **Remember:** *You are your own bank*.

From the in-app exchange module
-------------------------------

The in-app exchange module allows you to obtain PART funds without the need to visit an external exchange. At a later stage this will be used as onramp and offramp for many different currencies including Fiat like US Dollar or Euro.

.. note::

	**Prerequisite:** Enable the desired exchange bot.

	#. Navigate to the :guilabel:`Bot Management` module.
	#. Choose an exchange and enable its bot by expanding its tile and then clicking on the :guilabel:`Enable bot` button.

.. rst-class:: bignums

	#. Navigate to the :guilabel:`Exchange` module of the wallet menu on the left of your Particl Desktop client.
	#. Click on the :guilabel:`Start new Exchange` button. 
	#. Type in the number of PART coins you want to receive in your public balance.
	#. Select the cryptocurrency you want to swap for PART coins, and then click on the :guilabel:`Next` button.
	#. Review the quote offered by the exchange, and then click on the :guilabel:`Next` button.
	#. Send your coins to the address provided and wait for the transaction to be completed. This can take several minutes depending on the exchange and the currency you trade for.

Convert Balances

	#. Type in the number of coins you want to send to your anon balance and click on the :guilabel:`Make payment` button.
		- Unlock your wallet when prompted to.
	#. Review the transaction details and click on the :guilabel:`Confirm & Send` button to confirm the transaction.
	#. Wait for twelve (12) confirmations (approximately 24 minutes) before the funds in the anon balance can be used.
