Manage Funds
==============

There are three different types of coin balances on Particl. Each of them serves a different function within the platform and carries their own level of transactional privacy.

To sell products and services on Particl, you'll need to have coins in both your ``Public`` balance and in your ``Anon`` balance.

To buy products and services on Particl, you'll only need to have coins in your ``Public`` balance ``Anon`` balance. It is, however, quite useful to also have some coins in your ``Public`` balance as that will allow you to take part in the moderation process of the marketplace by flagging undesirable items and also earn a bit of passive income through Particl's staking process.
