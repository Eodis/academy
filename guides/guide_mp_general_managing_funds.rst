.. note::

	With Particl's native currency (PART), there are three different types of transactions: 

	#. :ref:`Public transactions` 
	#. :ref:`Blind transactions` 
	#. :ref:`Anon transactions` 

	Each of them serves a different function within the platform and carries its own level of transactional privacy.

Needed Funds
------------

**PART funds needed for selling**

To sell products and services on :term:`Particl Marketplace`, you typically need to have coins in both your :guilabel:`Public` balance and in your :guilabel:`Anon` balance. If you enable the *Use spendable (Anon) balance for publishing fees* option in your market settings, then you only need to have funds in your :guilabel:`Anon` balance. Keep in mind publishing listings will be more expensive if you choose that option.

**PART funds needed for buying**

To buy products and services on :term:`Particl Marketplace`, you only need to have coins in your :guilabel:`Anon` balance.

Receive Coins 
-------------

There are multiple ways you can fund your balances with PART coins.

**From another PART address**

Receive PART coins coming from any wallet holding PART funds. This can be a personal wallet, a public exchange service provider, or a hardware wallet. 

.. rst-class:: bignums

	#. Open :guilabel:`Wallet` -> :guilabel:`Receive`.
	#. Receive a public transaction by choosing :guilabel:`Public` from the tabs menu at the top of the page, or choose the :guilabel:`Private` tab instead if you want to receive a private transaction (either :guilabel:`Blind` or :guilabel:`Anon`). 
	#. Share your address with the party to receive the funds.  
	
.. tip::

	#. Both the sender and receiver must agree on the transaction type (exchanges, for example, only support :guilabel:`Public` transactions).
	#. Create a new :guilabel:`Receive` address for every transaction. (Optional, but recommended for better privacy).
	#. Adding a label to an address is really helpful to better keep track of your transactions. 
	#. When posting the address from the clipboard to another party, always verify and double-check the pasted address with the original. Make sure they are identical. Remember: **You are your own bank**.

**From the in-app swap-exchange module**

The in-app swap-exchange module allows you to obtain PART funds without the need to visit an external exchange or directly deal with another party.

Convert Balances
----------------

Switching your coins from one type of balance to another is required to make different types of transactions. Refer to the :doc:`PART Coin Explained <../in-depth/indepth_part_coin>` in-depth guide for more details on transaction types and balances. 

.. rst-class:: bignums

	#. Open :guilabel:`Wallet` -> :guilabel:`Send / Convert` ->  :guilabel:`Convert Public & Private`.
	#. In the :guilabel:`Pay From` section, select the source of funds you would like to convert. In the :guilabel:`Convert To` section, select the destination of funds you would like to receive.
	#. Type in the number of coins you want to send to your other balance and click on the :guilabel:`Make Payment` button.
	#. Review the transaction details and click on the :guilabel:`Confirm & Send` button to start the process.
		
.. tip:: 

    #. Wait for twelve (12) confirmations (approximately 24 minutes) before the funds in the anon balance can be used without restriction.
    #. You can track the status of transactions in the :guilabel:`Overview` module under :guilabel:`Recent Transactions`.
